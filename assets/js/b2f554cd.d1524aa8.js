For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.\\n\\n## Introduction to RBAC\\n\\nRBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let\'s take a look at Azure\'s RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.\\n\\n## Understanding Azure\'s Hierarchical RBAC\\n\\n![Azure Hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png)\\n\\nThere is a role called **Owner** for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the **Owner** role assigned to me at the\\nsubscription level, that means I am the **Owner** of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have\\n**Owner** at the resource group level, then I am the **Owner** of all the resources under that resource group.\\n\\nThis image shows that I have **Owner** access at the subscription level. ![Subscription Owner](/img/tutorial/subscription-owner.png)\\n\\nWhen I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited **Owner** access from the\\nsubscription. ![RG Owner](/img/tutorial/rg-owner.png)\\n\\nSo, this is how Azure\'s RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical\\nnature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we\'ll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.\\n\\n## How Does Casbin Work?\\n\\nBefore diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.\\n\\n## What is ACL?\\n\\nACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s consider a simple example of an ACL model.\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act\\n```\\n\\n1. The **request_definition** is the query template of the system. For example, a request `alice, write, data1` can be\\ninterpreted as \\"Can subject Alice perform the action \'write\' on object \'data1\'?\\".\\n\\n2. The **policy_definition** is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy `alice, write, data1`, you are\\nassigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action \'write\' on object \'data1\'.\\n\\n3. The **policy_effect** defines the effect of the policy.\\n\\n4. In the **matchers** section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions `r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act`.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, read, data1\\np, bob, write, data2\\n```\\n\\nand the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, read, data1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the ACL model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![acl](/img/tutorial/acl.png)\\n\\n## What is RBAC?\\n\\nRBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s consider a simple example RBAC model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\ng2 = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && r.obj == p.obj\\n```\\n\\n1. The **role_definition** is a graph relation builder that uses a Graph to compare the request object with the policy object.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, reader, data1\\np, bob, owner, data2\\n\\ng, reader, read\\ng, owner, read\\ng, owner, write\\n```\\n\\nand the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, read, data1\\nalice, write, data1\\nbob, write, data2\\nbob, read, data2\\nbob, write, data1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\nfalse\\ntrue\\ntrue\\nfalse\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![rbac](/img/tutorial/rbac.png)\\n\\nThe **g - Role to action mapping** table has a Graph mapping the role to action. This Graph can be coded as a list of edges, as shown in the policy which is a common way of representing a Graph:\\n\\n```csv\\ng, reader, read\\ng, owner, read\\ng, owner, write\\n```\\n\\n:::info\\n\\n**p** indicates a normal policy that can be compared using the **==** operator. **g** is a Graph-based comparison function. You can define multiple Graph comparators by adding a numerical suffix like **g, g2, g3, ...** and so on.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## What is Hierarchical RBAC?\\n\\nIn Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, \\"subscription\\" is one type and \\"resourceGroup\\" is another type. A sub1 of type **Subscription** can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type **ResourceGroup**.\\n\\nSimilar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role **sub-owner**. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role **rg-owner**, which means that if I am assigned the **sub-owner** role on Subscription **sub1**, then I automatically also get the **rg-owner** role on **rg1 and rg2**.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s take a simple example of the **Hierarchical RBAC** model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\ng2 = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && g2(p.obj, r.obj)\\n```\\n\\n1. The **role_definition** is a graph relation builder which uses a Graph to compare the request object with the policy object.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, sub-reader, sub1\\np, bob, rg-owner, rg2\\n\\n// subscription role to subscription action mapping\\ng, sub-reader, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-write\\n\\n// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping\\ng, rg-reader, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-write\\n\\n// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping\\ng, sub-reader, rg-reader\\ng, sub-owner, rg-owner\\n\\n// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping\\ng2, sub1, rg1\\ng2, sub2, rg2\\n```\\n\\nAnd paste the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, rg-read, rg1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![hrbac](/img/tutorial/hrbac.png)\\n\\nThe **g - Role to (Action, Role) Mapping** table has a graph mapping the role to the action, role mapping. This graph can be coded as a list of edges, as shown in the policy, which is a common way of representing a graph:\\n\\n```csv\\n// subscription role to subscription action mapping\\ng, sub-reader, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-write\\n\\n// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping\\ng, rg-reader, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-write\\n\\n// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping\\ng, sub-reader, rg-reader\\ng, sub-owner, rg-owner\\n```\\n\\nThe **g2 - Sub to RG Mapping** table has a graph mapping subscription to resourceGroup:\\n\\n```csv\\n// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping\\ng2, sub1, rg1\\ng2, sub2, rg2\\n```\\n\\n#### Subject Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-sub-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-sub-match.png)\\n\\n#### Action Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-act-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-act-match.png)\\n\\n#### Object Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-obj-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-obj-match.png)\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nWhen a request is submitted to Casbin, this matching happens for all the policies. If at least one policy matches, then the result of the request is true. If no policy matches the request, then the result is false.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we learned about how different authorization models work and how they can be modeled using Casbin. In the second part of this tutorial, we will implement this in a demo Spring Boot Application and secure the APIs using Casbin."},{"id":"/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/blog/2021-08-19-apisix-casbin-authorization.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-19-apisix-casbin-authorization.md","title":"Authorization in APISIX using Casbin","description":"Introduction","date":"2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 19, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":5.51,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Rushikesh Tote","title":"Member of Casbin","url":"http://github.com/rushitote","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/rushitote"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Authorization in APISIX using Casbin","author":"Rushikesh Tote","authorTitle":"Member of Casbin","authorURL":"http://github.com/rushitote","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/rushitote"},"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding How Casbin Matching Works in Detail","permalink":"/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail"},"nextItem":{"title":"Yang Luo - Google Open Source Peer Bonus Winner","permalink":"/blog/2020/04/21/google-award"}},"content":"## Introduction\\n\\n[APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/) is a high performance and scalable cloud native API gateway based on Nginx and etcd. It is an open source project by the Apache Software Foundation. Besides that, what makes APISIX so good is the support of many great built in plugins that could be used to implement features like authentication, monitoring, routing, etc. And the fact that plugins in APISIX are hot-reloaded (without restarts) makes it very dynamic.\\n\\nBut while using APISIX, there may be scenarios where you might want to add complex authorization logic in your application. This is where authz-casbin might help you, authz-casbin is an APISIX plugin based on [Lua Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/) that enables powerful authorization based on various access control models. [Casbin](/) is an authorization library which supports access control models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC. Originally written in Go, it has been ported to many languages and Lua Casbin is the Lua implementation of Casbin. The development of authz-casbin started when we proposed a new plugin for authorization in the APISIX repository ([#4674](https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674)) to which the core members agreed. And after the helpful reviews which led to some major changes and improvements, the PR ([#4710](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710)) was finally merged. \\n\\nIn this blog, we will use the authz-casbin plugin to show how you can implement an authorization model based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in APISIX.\\n\\n**NOTE**: You will need to use some other plugin or custom workflow for authenticating the user since Casbin will only do authorization and not authentication.\\n\\n## Creating a model\\n\\nThe plugin uses three parameters for authorizing any request - subject, object and action. Here, subject is the value of  the username header, which could be something like `[username: alice]`. Then, the object is the URL path that is being accessed and the action is request method being used.\\n\\nLet\'s say we want to create a model with three resources at the paths - `/`, `/res1` and `/res2`. And we want to have a model like this:\\n\\n![image](/img/blog/model.png)\\n\\nThis would mean that all users (`*`) like for example `jack` can access the homepage (`/`). And users with `admin` permissions like `alice` and `bob` can access all the pages and resources (like `res1` and `res2`). Also, let\'s restrict users without any admin permissions to using only `GET` request method. For this scenario, we could define the model as:\\n\\n```ini\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\n```\\n\\n## Creating a policy\\n\\nFrom the above scenario, the policy would be:\\n\\n```csv\\np, *, /, GET\\np, admin, *, *\\ng, alice, admin\\ng, bob, admin\\n```\\n\\nThe matcher from the model means:\\n\\n1. `(g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub))`: Either the request\'s subject has a role as the policy\'s subject or the request\'s subject matches the policy\'s subject in `keyMatch`. `keyMatch` is built in function in Lua Casbin, you can take a look at the function\'s description and more such functions that could be useful [here](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/blob/master/src/util/BuiltInFunctions.lua).\\n2. `keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj)`: The request\'s object matches the policy\'s object (URL path here).\\n3. `keyMatch(r.act, p.act)`: The request\'s action matches the policy\'s action (HTTP request method here).\\n\\n## Enabling the plugin on route\\n\\nOnce you have created the model and policy, you can enable it on a route using the APISIX Admin API. To enable it using model and policy file paths:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"model_path\\": \\"/path/to/model.conf\\",\\n            \\"policy_path\\": \\"/path/to/policy.csv\\",\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"upstream\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127.0.0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nHere, the username field is the header name that you will be using to pass in the subject. For example, if you will be passing the username header as `user: alice`, you would use `\\"username\\": \\"user\\"`.\\n\\nFor using model/policy text instead of files, you can use the `model` and `policy` fields instead:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"model\\": \\"[request_definition]\\n            r = sub, obj, act\\n\\n            [policy_definition]\\n            p = sub, obj, act\\n\\n            [role_definition]\\n            g = _, _\\n\\n            [policy_effect]\\n            e = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n            [matchers]\\n            m = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\",\\n\\n            \\"policy\\": \\"p, *, /, GET\\n            p, admin, *, *\\n            g, alice, admin\\n            g, bob, admin\\",\\n\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"upstream\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127.0.0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\n## Enabling the plugin using a global model/policy\\n\\nThere may be situations where you might want to use a single model and policy configuration across multiple routes. You can do that by first by sending a `PUT` request to add the model and policy configuration to the plugin\'s metadata by:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/plugin_metadata/authz-casbin -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -i -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n\\"model\\": \\"[request_definition]\\nr = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\",\\n\\n\\"policy\\": \\"p, *, /, GET\\np, admin, *, *\\ng, alice, admin\\ng, bob, admin\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nAnd then to enable the same configuration on some route, send a request using the Admin API:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"upstream\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127.0.0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/route1/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nThis will add the plugin metadata configuration to the route. You can also easily update the plugin metadata configuration by resending the request to plugin\'s metadata with updated model and policy configuration, the plugin will automatically update all the routes using the plugin metadata. \\n\\n## Use Cases\\n\\n- The primary use case of this plugin would be in implementing authorization in your APIs. You can easily add this plugin on any API route that you are using with your authorization model and policy configuration. \\n- If you want to have a single authorization model for all your APIs, you can use global model/policy method. This makes updating the policy easy for all routes, since you only need to update the metadata in etcd.\\n- While if you would like to use a different model for every different route, you can use the route method. This is helpful when different API routes have different sets of user permissions.

It has several features:\\n\\n- Purely developed in Golang.\\n- Can manage thousands of Casbin instances, so you can move policy enforcement logic from multiple services into one Casbin Server.\\n- **gRPC** is used to communicated with Casbin Server. We also consider to add the **RESTful** support in near future.\\n- A friendly web administrator portal is provided for non-developer administrators to manage all details like Casbin instances, models, policy storage and load balancing.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe source code is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server\\n\\nAny issues or pull requests are welcome :)"}]}')}}]);
