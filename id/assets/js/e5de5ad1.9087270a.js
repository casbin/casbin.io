The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been adopted by Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and many others, and the way applications talk to external services is changing. That shift brings a new set of authorization challenges we at Casbin have been working on.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The World Has Changed\\n\\nWhen we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.\\n\\nThe MCP spec now classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (June 2025 update), with fine-grained scopes like `mcp:tools:weather` or `mcp:resources:customer-data:read`. That is the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for; integration with MCP and OAuth still needs more work.\\n\\n## What We\'re Working On\\n\\n### MCP Server Authorization\\n\\nThis is one of our main focus areas. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, the server must decide: can this agent, on behalf of this user, invoke this tool with these parameters?\\n\\nTraditional RBAC is not enough. You need something like ABAC\u2014e.g. \u201cis this agent allowed to access customer data for Alice\u2019s region during business hours?\u201d We are exploring how Casbin\u2019s policy model can express these constraints.\\n\\nThe catch: MCP servers must decide very quickly. We are looking at lightweight policy evaluation inside the MCP server process instead of calling a separate authorization service.\\n\\n### Edge-First Authorization\\n\\nCloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can\'t afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.\\n\\nThis is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don\'t have all the answers yet, but it\'s where things are heading.\\n\\nWe\'re particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they\'ve built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.\\n\\n### RAG Pipeline Authorization\\n\\nA recurring theme: companies building RAG systems where the LLM must access internal documents, but each user should only see documents they are allowed to see.\\n\\nThe OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists \u201cSensitive Information Disclosure\u201d as a major risk. The fix is not only to filter outputs but to ensure the LLM never retrieves documents the user is not authorized to access.\\n\\nSo authorization must happen at the vector store query level. We are looking at turning Casbin policies into metadata filters for vector DBs\u2014i.e. a permission check becomes a WHERE clause pushed down to retrieval.\\n\\n### Multi-Agent Scenarios\\n\\nWith multiple agents in a chain (e.g. coding agent \u2192 deployment agent \u2192 monitoring agent), permission delegation is tricky. Each agent may have different capabilities, and you must track the full chain.\\n\\nOAuth\u2019s On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow covers part of this, but the logic for \u201ccan agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice\u201d needs a clear model. Casbin\u2019s role hierarchies and domain RBAC could extend to agent hierarchies; we are working through the semantics.\\n\\n## The Traditional Roadmap Stuff\\n\\nOf course, we\'re not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:\\n\\n**Language implementations catching up** - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The `in` operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the `g` function - these need to be consistent everywhere.\\n\\n**New framework middlewares** - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.\\n\\n**Performance work** - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.\\n\\n## What we don\u2019t know yet\\n\\nThe AI agent authorization space is moving fast; we are learning as we go. Open questions:\\n\\n- Should Casbin have first-class primitives for \\"agent identity\\" vs \\"user identity\\"?\\n- How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?\\n- What\'s the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?\\n\\nIf you are building in this space and hitting authorization problems, we want to hear from you. The best features come from real use cases.\\n\\n## Getting involved\\n\\nWe have been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related topics are a good fit for summer projects. You do not need to wait for GSoC\u2014if this sounds interesting, reach out on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.\\n\\nThe next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We\'re excited to figure them out together."},{"id":"/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail","metadata":{"permalink":"/id/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/id/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-12-08-understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail.md","source":"@site/i18n/id/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-12-08-understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail.md","title":"Understanding How Casbin Matching Works in Detail","description":"This post explains how to design and implement RBAC with the Casbin library.

For SaaS platforms with resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions, Casbin is a performant option.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction to RBAC\\n\\nRBAC restricts access based on the roles users hold. To see how **hierarchical** RBAC works, we look at Azure\u2019s RBAC and then implement something similar in Casbin.\\n\\n## Azure\u2019s hierarchical RBAC\\n\\n![Azure Hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png)\\n\\nIn Azure, the **Owner** role applies at different scopes. If I have **Owner** at the subscription level, I am Owner of all resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have Owner at a resource group level, I am Owner of all resources in that group.\\n\\nThe image below shows Owner access at the subscription level. ![Subscription Owner](/img/tutorial/subscription-owner.png)\\n\\nChecking IAM for a resource group under that subscription shows inherited Owner access. ![RG Owner](/img/tutorial/rg-owner.png)\\n\\nThat is how Azure\u2019s RBAC is hierarchical. Many systems use similar hierarchies. In this tutorial we implement a comparable model with Casbin.\\n\\n## How Casbin works\\n\\nUnderstanding Casbin\u2019s building blocks (request, policy, matcher, effect) makes it easier to design and tune your RBAC model.\\n\\n## What is ACL?\\n\\n**ACL (Access Control List)** maps users to actions and actions to resources.\\n\\n### Model definition\\n\\nA minimal ACL model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act\\n```\\n\\n1. **request_definition** \u2014 Defines the request format. E.g. `alice, write, data1` means \u201cCan Alice write data1?\u201d\\n2. **policy_definition** \u2014 Defines the policy format. E.g. a policy `alice, write, data1` grants Alice permission to write data1.\\n3. **policy_effect** \u2014 How multiple matching policies are combined (e.g. allow-override).\\n4. **matchers** \u2014 The condition that must hold: `r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act`.\\n\\n### Try it in the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [Casbin editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the model above into the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, read, data1\\np, bob, write, data2\\n```\\n\\nand the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, read, data1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the ACL model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![acl](/img/tutorial/acl.png)\\n\\n## What is RBAC?\\n\\n**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** assigns users to roles; roles have permissions on resources. A request checks whether the user\u2019s role allows the action on the resource.\\n\\n### Model definition\\n\\nA simple RBAC model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\ng2 = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && r.obj == p.obj\\n```\\n\\n1. **role_definition** \u2014 Defines graph relations (e.g. `g` for role\u2013role or user\u2013role). The matcher uses these to resolve roles and permissions.\\n\\n### Try it in the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the model above.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, reader, data1\\np, bob, owner, data2\\n\\ng, reader, read\\ng, owner, read\\ng, owner, write\\n```\\n\\nand the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, read, data1\\nalice, write, data1\\nbob, write, data2\\nbob, read, data2\\nbob, write, data1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\nfalse\\ntrue\\ntrue\\nfalse\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![rbac](/img/tutorial/rbac.png)\\n\\nThe **g** (role-to-action) relation is a graph. In policy it is written as edges, for example:\\n\\n```csv\\ng, reader, read\\ng, owner, read\\ng, owner, write\\n```\\n\\n:::info\\n**p** is a normal policy (compared with `==`). **g** is a graph relation. You can add more with suffixes: **g2**, **g3**, etc.\\n:::\\n\\n## Hierarchical RBAC\\n\\nIn hierarchical RBAC there are multiple **resource types** with inheritance (e.g. Subscription \u2192 ResourceGroup). A subscription **sub1** can contain resource groups **rg1**, **rg2**. Similarly, there are subscription-level roles/actions and resource-group-level roles/actions, with inheritance between them. For example, the subscription role **sub-owner** might inherit to the resource-group role **rg-owner**: if I have **sub-owner** on **sub1**, I effectively have **rg-owner** on **rg1** and **rg2**.\\n\\n### Model definition\\n\\nA minimal hierarchical RBAC model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\ng2 = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && g2(p.obj, r.obj)\\n```\\n\\nHere **g** links roles/actions and **g2** links resources (e.g. subscription to resource group).\\n\\n### Try it in the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the model above.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, sub-reader, sub1\\np, bob, rg-owner, rg2\\n\\n// subscription role to subscription action mapping\\ng, sub-reader, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-write\\n\\n// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping\\ng, rg-reader, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-write\\n\\n// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping\\ng, sub-reader, rg-reader\\ng, sub-owner, rg-owner\\n\\n// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping\\ng2, sub1, rg1\\ng2, sub2, rg2\\n```\\n\\nAnd paste the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, rg-read, rg1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![hrbac](/img/tutorial/hrbac.png)\\n\\nThe **g** edges (role \u2192 action, role \u2192 role) can be written in policy as:\\n\\n```csv\\n// subscription role to subscription action mapping\\ng, sub-reader, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-write\\n\\n// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping\\ng, rg-reader, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-write\\n\\n// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping\\ng, sub-reader, rg-reader\\ng, sub-owner, rg-owner\\n```\\n\\nThe **g2** edges map subscription to resource group:\\n\\n```csv\\n// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping\\ng2, sub1, rg1\\ng2, sub2, rg2\\n```\\n\\n#### Subject Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-sub-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-sub-match.png)\\n\\n#### Action Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-act-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-act-match.png)\\n\\n#### Object Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-obj-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-obj-match.png)\\n\\n:::info\\nCasbin evaluates the request against all policies.

It ships with many plugins for authentication, monitoring, routing, and more. Plugins are hot-reloaded without restarts, so you can change behavior on the fly.\\n\\nWhen you need **authorization** beyond simple checks, the **authz-casbin** plugin can help. It is an APISIX plugin built on [Lua Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/) that enforces flexible authorization using models such as ACL, RBAC, and ABAC. [Casbin](/) is an authorization library (originally in Go, now ported to many languages); Lua Casbin is the Lua port. We proposed the plugin in the APISIX repo ([#4674](https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674)); after review and improvements, it was merged ([#4710](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710)).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis post shows how to implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in APISIX using authz-casbin.\\n\\n**Note:** Casbin handles **authorization** only. Use another plugin or your own logic for **authentication** (identifying the user).\\n\\n## Membuat model\\n\\nThe plugin authorizes each request using three parameters: **subject**, **object**, and **action**. The subject comes from a header (e.g. `username: alice`), the object is the URL path, and the action is the HTTP method.\\n\\nSuppose we have three paths: `/`, `/res1`, and `/res2`. We want a model like this:\\n\\n![gambar](/img/blog/model.png)\\n\\nSo: any user (e.g. `jack`) can access `/`; users with the `admin` role (e.g. `alice`, `bob`) can access everything; and non-admin users are limited to `GET`. Here is a model that does that:\\n\\n```ini\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\n```\\n\\n## Membuat kebijakan\\n\\nFor the scenario above, the policy could be:\\n\\n```csv\\np, *, /, GET\\np, admin, *, *\\ng, alice, admin\\ng, bob, admin\\n```\\n\\nThe matcher means:\\n\\n1. **`(g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub))`** \u2014 The request subject either has the policy subject as a role or matches it via `keyMatch`. For `keyMatch` and other built-ins, see [Lua Casbin BuiltInFunctions](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/blob/master/src/util/BuiltInFunctions.lua).\\n2. **`keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj)`** \u2014 The request path matches the policy object.\\n3. **`keyMatch(r.act, p.act)`** \u2014 The request method matches the policy action.\\n\\n## Enabling the plugin on a route\\n\\nAfter creating the model and policy, enable the plugin on a route via the APISIX Admin API. Using **file paths**:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"model_path\\": \\"/path/to/model.conf\\",\\n            \\"policy_path\\": \\"/path/to/policy.csv\\",\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"upstream\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127.0.0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nThe `username` field is the **header name** that carries the subject (e.g. if the header is `user: alice`, set `\\"username\\": \\"user\\"`).\\n\\nTo use **inline** model and policy text instead of files, use the `model` and `policy` fields:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"model\\": \\"[request_definition]\\n            r = sub, obj, act\\n\\n            [policy_definition]\\n            p = sub, obj, act\\n\\n            [role_definition]\\n            g = _, _\\n\\n            [policy_effect]\\n            e = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n            [matchers]\\n            m = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\",\\n\\n            \\"policy\\": \\"p, *, /, GET\\n            p, admin, *, *\\n            g, alice, admin\\n            g, bob, admin\\",\\n\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"upstream\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127.0.0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\n## Using a global model and policy\\n\\nTo use one model and policy for **all** routes, store them in the plugin\u2019s metadata. Send a `PUT` request:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/plugin_metadata/authz-casbin -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -i -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n\\"model\\": \\"[request_definition]\\nr = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\",\\n\\n\\"policy\\": \\"p, *, /, GET\\np, admin, *, *\\ng, alice, admin\\ng, bob, admin\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nThen enable the plugin on a route (it will use the metadata). Example:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"upstream\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127.0.0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/route1/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nThe route then uses the shared model and policy from metadata. To change them, send another `PUT` to the plugin metadata; all routes using it will pick up the update.\\n\\n## Use cases\\n\\n- **Per-route authorization** \u2014 Attach the plugin to any route with your model and policy. Good when different routes need different permissions or when policies are large (each route only loads what it needs).\\n- **Global model/policy** \u2014 Store one model and policy in plugin metadata and reference it from many routes. Updating policy in one place (e.g. etcd) updates all those routes."},{"id":"/2020/04/21/google-award","metadata":{"permalink":"/id/blog/2020/04/21/google-award","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/id/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2020-04-21-google-award.md","source":"@site/i18n/id/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2020-04-21-google-award.md","title":"Yang Luo \u2014 Google Open Source Peer Bonus Winner","description":"We are pleased to announce that Casbin\u2019s founder, Yang Luo, was named a Google Open Source Peer Bonus winner for his work on Casbin, Npcap, and Nmap in 2019 Q3.","date":"2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.91,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Casbin","title":"Official Account","url":"https://github.com/casbin","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/casbin","key":"casbin","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Yang Luo \u2014 Google Open Source Peer Bonus Winner","authors":["casbin"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Authorization in APISIX Using Casbin","permalink":"/id/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization"},"nextItem":{"title":"Reworking Our Documentation","permalink":"/id/blog/2018/09/23/new-website"}},"content":"We are pleased to announce that Casbin\u2019s founder, [Yang Luo](https://github.com/hsluoyz), was named a [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.google.com/docs/growing/peer-bonus/) winner for his work on [Casbin](/), [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/), and [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) in 2019 Q3.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![ospb](https://hsluoyz.github.io/download/Open%20Source%20Peer%20Bonus%20Q3%202019%20-%20Yang%20Luo%20-%20OSPB%20Award%20Letter.png)\\n\\n> The full award letter is available [here](https://github.com/hsluoyz/hsluoyz.github.io/blob/master/download/Open%20Source%20Peer%20Bonus%20Q3%202019%20-%20Yang%20Luo%20-%20OSPB%20Award%20Letter.pdf).\\n\\nGoogle describes the program as:\\n\\n> _Just as a Google Peer Bonus recognizes a fellow Googler who has gone above and beyond, an Open Source Peer Bonus recognizes external contributors who have made exceptional contributions to open source._\\n\\nThe [2019 winners announcement](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/01/announcing-2019-second-cycle-google.html) lists Yang and Casbin alongside other impactful projects and developers, including Git, TensorFlow, V8, CPython, LLVM, Apache projects, Angular, and Jenkins.\\n\\nWe are proud to see Casbin recognized for its work in open source and cloud security.\\n\\n_Terima kasih telah menggunakan Casbin!_"},{"id":"/2018/09/23/new-website","metadata":{"permalink":"/id/blog/2018/09/23/new-website","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/id/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2018-09-23-new-website.md","source":"@site/i18n/id/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2018-09-23-new-website.md","title":"Reworking Our Documentation","description":"We have moved Casbin\u2019s documentation from GitHub Wiki to the Docs section of this site, powered by Docusaurus.
