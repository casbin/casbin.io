            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2024 was the year AI agents went from demos to production. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-world-has-changed">The World Has Changed<a href="#the-world-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke The World Has Changed" title="Tautan langsung ke The World Has Changed">​</a></h2><p>When we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.</p><p>The MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like <code>mcp:tools:weather</code> or <code>mcp:resources:customer-data:read</code>. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-were-working-on">What We're Working On<a href="#what-were-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke What We're Working On" title="Tautan langsung ke What We're Working On">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="mcp-server-authorization">MCP Server Authorization<a href="#mcp-server-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke MCP Server Authorization" title="Tautan langsung ke MCP Server Authorization">​</a></h3><p>This is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?</p><p>Traditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just "is alice an admin" but "is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice's region during business hours." We're exploring how Casbin's policy model can express these constraints naturally.</p><p>The challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We're looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="edge-first-authorization">Edge-First Authorization<a href="#edge-first-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke Edge-First Authorization" title="Tautan langsung ke Edge-First Authorization">​</a></h3><p>Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can't afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.</p><p>This is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don't have all the answers yet, but it's where things are heading.</p><p>We're particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they've built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="rag-pipeline-authorization">RAG Pipeline Authorization<a href="#rag-pipeline-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke RAG Pipeline Authorization" title="Tautan langsung ke RAG Pipeline Authorization">​</a></h3><p>Here's something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.</p><p>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists "Sensitive Information Disclosure" as a major risk. The solution isn't just filtering outputs - it's ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn't have access to in the first place.</p><p>This means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We're thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="multi-agent-scenarios">Multi-Agent Scenarios<a href="#multi-agent-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke Multi-Agent Scenarios" title="Tautan langsung ke Multi-Agent Scenarios">​</a></h3><p>When you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.</p><p>The OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for "can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice" needs a proper model. Casbin's support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-traditional-roadmap-stuff">The Traditional Roadmap Stuff<a href="#the-traditional-roadmap-stuff" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" title="Tautan langsung ke The Traditional Roadmap Stuff">​</a></h2><p>Of course, we're not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:</p><p><strong>Language implementations catching up</strong> - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The <code>in</code> operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the <code>g</code> function - these need to be consistent everywhere.</p><p><strong>New framework middlewares</strong> - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.</p><p><strong>Performance work</strong> - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-we-dont-know-yet">What We Don't Know Yet<a href="#what-we-dont-know-yet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke What We Don't Know Yet" title="Tautan langsung ke What We Don't Know Yet">​</a></h2><p>Honestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we're learning as we go. Some open questions:</p><ul><li>Should Casbin have first-class primitives for "agent identity" vs "user identity"?</li><li>How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?</li><li>What's the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?</li></ul><p>If you're building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="getting-involved">Getting Involved<a href="#getting-involved" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke Getting Involved" title="Tautan langsung ke Getting Involved">​</a></h2><p>We've been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don't need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.</p><p>The next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We're excited to figure them out together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the <a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casbin</a> library. For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="introduction-to-rbac">Introduction to RBAC<a href="#introduction-to-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke Introduction to RBAC" title="Tautan langsung ke Introduction to RBAC">​</a></h2><p>RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let's take a look at Azure's RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac">Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC<a href="#understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" title="Tautan langsung ke Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png" alt="Azure Hierarchy" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There is a role called <strong>Owner</strong> for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the <strong>Owner</strong> role assigned to me at the
subscription level, that means I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
<strong>Owner</strong> at the resource group level, then I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resources under that resource group.</p><p>This image shows that I have <strong>Owner</strong> access at the subscription level. <img loading="lazy" alt="Subscription Owner" src="/id/assets/images/subscription-owner-f1a7e1c9c03d7c587ce910ae5e6d8a35.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited <strong>Owner</strong> access from the
subscription. <img loading="lazy" alt="RG Owner" src="/id/assets/images/rg-owner-9c6cd2ae5997a5fba717c445f43130e6.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So, this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-does-casbin-work">How Does Casbin Work?<a href="#how-does-casbin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke How Does Casbin Work?" title="Tautan langsung ke How Does Casbin Work?">​</a></h2><p>Before diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-acl">What is ACL?<a href="#what-is-acl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke What is ACL?" title="Tautan langsung ke What is ACL?">​</a></h2><p>ACL stands for Access Control List.

For example, "subscription" is one type and "resourceGroup" is another type. A sub1 of type <strong>Subscription</strong> can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>.</p><p>Similar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role <strong>sub-owner</strong>. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role <strong>rg-owner</strong>, which means that if I am assigned the <strong>sub-owner</strong> role on Subscription <strong>sub1</strong>, then I

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="pengantar">Pengantar<a href="#pengantar" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke Pengantar" title="Tautan langsung ke Pengantar">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APISIX</a> adalah gateway API berkinerja tinggi dan dapat diskalakan yang bersifat cloud native, berbasis Nginx dan etcd. Ini adalah proyek sumber terbuka oleh Yayasan Perangkat Lunak Apache. Selain itu, yang membuat APISIX begitu baik adalah dukungan untuk banyak plugin bawaan yang hebat yang dapat digunakan untuk mengimplementasikan fitur seperti autentikasi, pemantauan, perutean, dll. Dan fakta bahwa plugin di APISIX dimuat ulang secara dinamis (tanpa memulai ulang) membuatnya sangat dinamis.</p><p>Namun, saat menggunakan APISIX, mungkin ada skenario di mana Anda ingin menambahkan logika otorisasi yang kompleks dalam aplikasi Anda. Di sinilah authz-casbin mungkin dapat membantu Anda, authz-casbin adalah plugin APISIX yang didasarkan pada <a href="https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lua Casbin</a> yang memungkinkan otorisasi yang kuat berdasarkan berbagai model kontrol akses. <a href="/id/">Casbin</a> adalah pustaka otorisasi yang mendukung model kontrol akses seperti ACL, RBAC, ABAC. Awalnya ditulis dalam Go, Casbin telah diadaptasi ke banyak bahasa dan Lua Casbin adalah implementasi Lua dari Casbin. Pengembangan authz-casbin dimulai ketika kami mengusulkan plugin baru untuk otorisasi di repositori APISIX (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4674</a>) yang disetujui oleh anggota inti. Dan setelah tinjauan yang membantu yang menyebabkan beberapa perubahan dan peningkatan besar, PR (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4710</a>) akhirnya digabungkan.</p><p>Dalam blog ini, kami akan menggunakan plugin authz-casbin untuk menunjukkan bagaimana Anda dapat mengimplementasikan model otorisasi berbasis Role Based Access Control (RBAC) di APISIX.</p><p><strong>CATATAN</strong>: Anda perlu menggunakan plugin lain atau alur kerja kustom untuk mengautentikasi pengguna karena Casbin hanya akan melakukan otorisasi, bukan autentikasi.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="membuat-model">Membuat model<a href="#membuat-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Tautan langsung ke Membuat model" title="Tautan langsung ke Membuat model">​</a></h2><p>Plugin ini menggunakan tiga parameter untuk mengotorisasi setiap permintaan - subjek, objek, dan aksi. Di sini, subjek adalah nilai dari header nama pengguna, yang bisa berupa sesuatu seperti <code>[username: alice]</code>. Kemudian, objeknya adalah jalur URL yang diakses dan tindakannya adalah metode permintaan yang digunakan.</p><p>Misalkan kita ingin membuat model dengan tiga sumber daya pada jalur - <code>/`\`, </code>/res1<code>\</code> dan `<code>/res2</code>`<!-- -->. Dan kita ingin memiliki model seperti ini:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="gambar" src="/id/assets/images/model-1c0c2441dd19f8b957744635985283eb.png" width="4520" height="1720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ini berarti semua pengguna (<code>*`\`) misalnya </code>jack<code>\</code> dapat mengakses halaman utama (<code>/`\`). Dan pengguna dengan izin </code>admin<code>\</code> seperti <code>alice`\` dan </code>bob<code>\</code> dapat mengakses semua halaman dan sumber daya (seperti <code>res1`\` dan </code>res2<code>\</code>).
