            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2024 was the year AI agents went from demos to production. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-world-has-changed">The World Has Changed<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-world-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="The World Has Changed başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="The World Has Changed başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.</p>
<p>The MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like <code>mcp:tools:weather</code> or <code>mcp:resources:customer-data:read</code>. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-were-working-on">What We're Working On<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-were-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="What We're Working On başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="What We're Working On başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="mcp-server-authorization">MCP Server Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#mcp-server-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="MCP Server Authorization başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="MCP Server Authorization başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?</p>
<p>Traditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just "is alice an admin" but "is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice's region during business hours." We're exploring how Casbin's policy model can express these constraints naturally.</p>
<p>The challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We're looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="edge-first-authorization">Edge-First Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#edge-first-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Edge-First Authorization başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="Edge-First Authorization başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can't afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.</p>
<p>This is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don't have all the answers yet, but it's where things are heading.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they've built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="rag-pipeline-authorization">RAG Pipeline Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#rag-pipeline-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="RAG Pipeline Authorization başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="RAG Pipeline Authorization başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Here's something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.</p>
<p>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists "Sensitive Information Disclosure" as a major risk. The solution isn't just filtering outputs - it's ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn't have access to in the first place.</p>
<p>This means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We're thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="multi-agent-scenarios">Multi-Agent Scenarios<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#multi-agent-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Multi-Agent Scenarios başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="Multi-Agent Scenarios başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.</p>
<p>The OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for "can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice" needs a proper model. Casbin's support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.</p>

<p>Of course, we're not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:</p>
<p><strong>Language implementations catching up</strong> - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The <code>in</code> operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the <code>g</code> function - these need to be consistent everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>New framework middlewares</strong> - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.</p>
<p><strong>Performance work</strong> - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-we-dont-know-yet">What We Don't Know Yet<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-we-dont-know-yet" class="hash-link" aria-label="What We Don't Know Yet başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="What We Don't Know Yet başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Honestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we're learning as we go. Some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Should Casbin have first-class primitives for "agent identity" vs "user identity"?</li>
<li class="">How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?</li>
<li class="">What's the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.</p>

<p>We've been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don't need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>The next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We're excited to figure them out together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the <a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin</a> library. For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="introduction-to-rbac">Introduction to RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#introduction-to-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Introduction to RBAC başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="Introduction to RBAC başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let's take a look at Azure's RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac">Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png" alt="Azure Hierarchy" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There is a role called <strong>Owner</strong> for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the <strong>Owner</strong> role assigned to me at the
subscription level, that means I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
<strong>Owner</strong> at the resource group level, then I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resources under that resource group.</p>
<p>This image shows that I have <strong>Owner</strong> access at the subscription level. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subscription Owner" src="https://casbin.org/tr/assets/images/subscription-owner-f1a7e1c9c03d7c587ce910ae5e6d8a35.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited <strong>Owner</strong> access from the
subscription. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="RG Owner" src="https://casbin.org/tr/assets/images/rg-owner-9c6cd2ae5997a5fba717c445f43130e6.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So, this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="how-does-casbin-work">How Does Casbin Work?<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#how-does-casbin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="How Does Casbin Work? başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="How Does Casbin Work? başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-acl">What is ACL?<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-acl" class="hash-link" aria-label="What is ACL? başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="What is ACL? başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-model-definition">The model definition<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#the-model-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="The model definition başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="The model definition başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider a simple example of an ACL model.</p>
<div class="language-toml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-toml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[request_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">r = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">p = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_effect]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">e = some(where (p.eft == allow))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[matchers]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>request_definition</strong> is the query template of the system. For example, a request <code>alice, write, data1</code> can be
interpreted as "Can subject Alice perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'?".</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_definition</strong> is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy <code>alice, write, data1</code>, you are
assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_effect</strong> defines the effect of the policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>In the <strong>matchers</strong> section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions <code>r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-hierarchical-rbac">What is Hierarchical RBAC?<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="What is Hierarchical RBAC? başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="What is Hierarchical RBAC? başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, "subscription" is one type and "resourceGroup" is another type. A sub1 of type <strong>Subscription</strong> can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role <strong>sub-owner</strong>. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role <strong>rg-owner</strong>, which means that if I am assigned the <strong>sub-owner</strong> role on Subscription <strong>sub1</strong>, then I automatically also get the <strong>rg-owner</strong> role on <strong>rg1 and rg2</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">APISIX</a>, Nginx ve etcd üzerine kurulu yüksek performanslı ve ölçeklenebilir bir bulut yerel API ağ geçididir. Apache Yazılım Vakfı tarafından yürütülen açık kaynaklı bir projedir. APISIX'in bu kadar iyi olmasının yanı sıra, kimlik doğrulama, izleme, yönlendirme gibi özellikleri uygulamak için kullanılabilecek birçok harika yerleşik eklenti desteği bulunmaktadır. APISIX'teki eklentilerin yeniden başlatmalar olmadan sıcak yüklenebilmesi, onu çok dinamik kılmaktadır.</p>
<p>Ancak APISIX kullanırken, uygulamanızda karmaşık yetkilendirme mantığı eklemek isteyebileceğiniz senaryolar olabilir. İşte burada authz-casbin size yardımcı olabilir, authz-casbin, çeşitli erişim kontrol modellerine dayalı güçlü yetkilendirme sağlayan <a href="https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lua Casbin</a> tabanlı bir APISIX eklentisidir. <a class="" href="https://casbin.org/tr/">Casbin</a>, ACL, RBAC, ABAC gibi erişim kontrol modellerini destekleyen bir yetkilendirme kütüphanesidir. Başlangıçta Go dilinde yazılmış olan Casbin, birçok dilde port edilmiştir ve Lua Casbin, Casbin'in Lua uygulamasıdır. authz-casbin'in geliştirilmesi, APISIX deposunda yetkilendirme için yeni bir eklenti önerdiğimizde (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4674</a>) çekirdek üyelerin de onay vermesiyle başladı. Ve yararlı incelemeler sonucu bazı önemli değişiklikler ve iyileştirmeler yapıldıktan sonra, PR (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4710</a>) nihayet birleştirildi.</p>
<p>Bu blogda, authz-casbin eklentisini kullanarak APISIX'te Rol Tabanlı Erişim Kontrolü (RBAC) temelli bir yetkilendirme modelinin nasıl uygulanabileceğini göstereceğiz.</p>
<p><strong>NOT</strong>: Casbin sadece yetkilendirme yapacağı için kullanıcının kimlik doğrulaması için başka bir eklenti veya özel bir iş akışı kullanmanız gerekecektir.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="model-oluşturma">Model Oluşturma<a href="https://casbin.org/tr/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#model-olu%C5%9Fturma" class="hash-link" aria-label="Model Oluşturma başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" title="Model Oluşturma başlığına doğrudan bağlantı" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Eklenti, herhangi bir isteği yetkilendirmek için üç parametre kullanır - konu, nesne ve eylem. Burada, konu, kullanıcı adı başlığının değeridir ve <code>[username: alice]</code> gibi bir şey olabilir. Ardından, nesne erişilmekte olan URL yolu ve eylem kullanılan istek yöntemidir.</p>
<p>Diyelim ki <code>/</code>, <code>/res1</code> ve <code>/res2</code> yollarında üç kaynakla bir model oluşturmak istiyoruz. Ve şöyle bir model istiyoruz:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="resim" src="https://casbin.org/tr/assets/images/model-1c0c2441dd19f8b957744635985283eb.png" width="4520" height="1720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Bu, örneğin <code>jack</code> gibi tüm kullanıcıların (<code>*</code>) anasayfasına (<code>/</code>) erişebileceği anlamına gelir. Ve <code>alice</code> ve <code>bob</code> gibi <code>admin</code> izinlerine sahip kullanıcılar tüm sayfalara ve kaynaklara (örneğin <code>res1</code> ve <code>res2</code>) erişebilir. Ayrıca, admin izni olmayan kullanıcıların sadece <code>GET</code> istek yöntemini kullanmasını kısıtlayalım. Bu senaryo için modeli şu şekilde tanımlayabiliriz:</p>

<li class="">Tüm API'leriniz için tek bir yetkilendirme modeline sahip olmak istiyorsanız, global model/politika yöntemini kullanabilirsiniz. Bu, politika güncellemesini tüm rotalar için kolaylaştırır, çünkü sadece etcd'deki meta verileri güncellemeniz yeterlidir.</li>
<li class="">Eğer her farklı rotaya farklı bir model kullanmak istiyorsanız, rota yöntemini kullanabilirsiniz. Bu, farklı API rotalarının farklı kullanıcı izinlerine sahip olduğunda yardımcı olur. Ayrıca, daha büyük politikalarla uğraşırken bunu kullanabilirsiniz, çünkü bu, yetkilendirmeyi birden çok rota filtrelendiğinde daha hızlı yapacaktır.</li>

Bugün, <strong>Erişim Kontrolü Olarak Hizmet</strong> için somut bir çözüm olarak <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin Server</a> projemizi başlattık.</p>
<p><strong>Casbin Server</strong>, çekirdek ekibimiz tarafından aktif olarak geliştirilmektedir. Çeşitli özelliklere sahiptir:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Sadece Golang ile geliştirilmiştir.</li>
<li class="">Binlerce Casbin örneğini yönetebilir, böylece politikaların uygulanması mantığını birden fazla hizmetten tek bir Casbin Server'a taşıyabilirsiniz.</li>
<li class=""><strong>gRPC</strong>, Casbin Server ile iletişim kurmak için kullanılır. Yakın gelecekte <strong>RESTful</strong> desteğini de eklemeyi düşünüyoruz.</li>
<li class="">Geliştirici olmayan yöneticilerin Casbin örnekleri, modeller, politikaların depolanması ve yük dengeleme gibi tüm detayları yönetmeleri için kullanışlı bir web yönetici portalı sağlanmıştır.</li>
