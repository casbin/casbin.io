            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2024 was the year AI agents went from demos to production. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-world-has-changed">The World Has Changed<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-world-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a The World Has Changed" title="Link diretto a The World Has Changed" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.</p>
<p>The MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like <code>mcp:tools:weather</code> or <code>mcp:resources:customer-data:read</code>. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-were-working-on">What We're Working On<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-were-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a What We're Working On" title="Link diretto a What We're Working On" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="mcp-server-authorization">MCP Server Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#mcp-server-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a MCP Server Authorization" title="Link diretto a MCP Server Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?</p>
<p>Traditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just "is alice an admin" but "is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice's region during business hours." We're exploring how Casbin's policy model can express these constraints naturally.</p>
<p>The challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We're looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="edge-first-authorization">Edge-First Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#edge-first-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a Edge-First Authorization" title="Link diretto a Edge-First Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can't afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.</p>
<p>This is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don't have all the answers yet, but it's where things are heading.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they've built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="rag-pipeline-authorization">RAG Pipeline Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#rag-pipeline-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a RAG Pipeline Authorization" title="Link diretto a RAG Pipeline Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Here's something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.</p>
<p>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists "Sensitive Information Disclosure" as a major risk. The solution isn't just filtering outputs - it's ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn't have access to in the first place.</p>
<p>This means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We're thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="multi-agent-scenarios">Multi-Agent Scenarios<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#multi-agent-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a Multi-Agent Scenarios" title="Link diretto a Multi-Agent Scenarios" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.</p>
<p>The OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for "can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice" needs a proper model. Casbin's support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-traditional-roadmap-stuff">The Traditional Roadmap Stuff<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-traditional-roadmap-stuff" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" title="Link diretto a The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Of course, we're not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:</p>
<p><strong>Language implementations catching up</strong> - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The <code>in</code> operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the <code>g</code> function - these need to be consistent everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>New framework middlewares</strong> - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.</p>
<p><strong>Performance work</strong> - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-we-dont-know-yet">What We Don't Know Yet<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-we-dont-know-yet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a What We Don't Know Yet" title="Link diretto a What We Don't Know Yet" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Honestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we're learning as we go. Some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Should Casbin have first-class primitives for "agent identity" vs "user identity"?</li>
<li class="">How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?</li>
<li class="">What's the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.</p>

<p>We've been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don't need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>The next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We're excited to figure them out together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the <a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin</a> library. For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="introduction-to-rbac">Introduction to RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#introduction-to-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a Introduction to RBAC" title="Link diretto a Introduction to RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let's take a look at Azure's RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac">Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" title="Link diretto a Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png" alt="Azure Hierarchy" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There is a role called <strong>Owner</strong> for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the <strong>Owner</strong> role assigned to me at the
subscription level, that means I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
<strong>Owner</strong> at the resource group level, then I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resources under that resource group.</p>
<p>This image shows that I have <strong>Owner</strong> access at the subscription level. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subscription Owner" src="https://casbin.org/it/assets/images/subscription-owner-f1a7e1c9c03d7c587ce910ae5e6d8a35.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited <strong>Owner</strong> access from the
subscription. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="RG Owner" src="https://casbin.org/it/assets/images/rg-owner-9c6cd2ae5997a5fba717c445f43130e6.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So, this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="how-does-casbin-work">How Does Casbin Work?<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#how-does-casbin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a How Does Casbin Work?" title="Link diretto a How Does Casbin Work?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-acl">What is ACL?<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-acl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a What is ACL?" title="Link diretto a What is ACL?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-model-definition">The model definition<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#the-model-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a The model definition" title="Link diretto a The model definition" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider a simple example of an ACL model.</p>
<div class="language-toml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-toml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[request_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">r = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">p = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_effect]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">e = some(where (p.eft == allow))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[matchers]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>request_definition</strong> is the query template of the system. For example, a request <code>alice, write, data1</code> can be
interpreted as "Can subject Alice perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'?".</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_definition</strong> is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy <code>alice, write, data1</code>, you are
assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_effect</strong> defines the effect of the policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>In the <strong>matchers</strong> section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions <code>r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-hierarchical-rbac">What is Hierarchical RBAC?<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a What is Hierarchical RBAC?" title="Link diretto a What is Hierarchical RBAC?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, "subscription" is one type and "resourceGroup" is another type. A sub1 of type <strong>Subscription</strong> can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role <strong>sub-owner</strong>. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role <strong>rg-owner</strong>, which means that if I am assigned the <strong>sub-owner</strong> role on Subscription <strong>sub1</strong>, then I automatically also get the <strong>rg-owner</strong> role on <strong>rg1 and rg2</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">APISIX</a> è un gateway API cloud nativo ad alte prestazioni e scalabile basato su Nginx e etcd. È un progetto open source della Apache Software Foundation. Oltre a ciò, ciò che rende APISIX così buono è il supporto di molti ottimi plugin integrati che possono essere utilizzati per implementare funzionalità come autenticazione, monitoraggio, routing, ecc. E il fatto che i plugin in APISIX siano ricaricati in modalità "hot" (senza riavvii) lo rende molto dinamico.</p>
<p>Tuttavia, durante l'uso di APISIX, potrebbero verificarsi scenari in cui potresti voler aggiungere logica di autorizzazione complessa nella tua applicazione. Questo è dove authz-casbin potrebbe aiutarti, authz-casbin è un plugin di APISIX basato su <a href="https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lua Casbin</a> che abilita un'autorizzazione potente basata su vari modelli di controllo degli accessi. <a class="" href="https://casbin.org/it/">Casbin</a> è una libreria di autorizzazione che supporta modelli di controllo degli accessi come ACL, RBAC, ABAC. Inizialmente scritto in Go, è stato portato in molte lingue e Lua Casbin è l'implementazione Lua di Casbin. Lo sviluppo di authz-casbin è iniziato quando abbiamo proposto un nuovo plugin per l'autorizzazione nel repository di APISIX (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4674</a>) a cui i membri core hanno dato il loro consenso. E dopo le utili revisioni che hanno portato a alcune modifiche e miglioramenti principali, la PR (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4710</a>) è stata finalmente unita.</p>
<p>In questo blog, useremo il plugin authz-casbin per mostrare come puoi implementare un modello di autorizzazione basato sul Controllo degli Accessi Basato sui Ruoli (RBAC) in APISIX.</p>
<p><strong>NOTA</strong>: Dovrai utilizzare qualche altro plugin o flusso di lavoro personalizzato per autenticare l'utente poiché Casbin farà solo autorizzazione e non autenticazione.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="creazione-di-un-modello">Creazione di un modello<a href="https://casbin.org/it/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#creazione-di-un-modello" class="hash-link" aria-label="Link diretto a Creazione di un modello" title="Link diretto a Creazione di un modello" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Il plugin utilizza tre parametri per autorizzare qualsiasi richiesta - soggetto, oggetto e azione. Qui, il soggetto è il valore dell'intestazione del nome utente, che potrebbe essere qualcosa come <code>[username: alice]</code>. Quindi, l'oggetto è il percorso URL che viene acceduto e l'azione è il metodo di richiesta utilizzato.</p>
<p>Diciamo che vogliamo creare un modello con tre risorse nei percorsi - <code>/`\`, </code>/res1<code>\</code> e ``/res2<code>\</code>. E vogliamo avere un modello come questo:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="immagine" src="https://casbin.org/it/assets/images/model-1c0c2441dd19f8b957744635985283eb.png" width="4520" height="1720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Ciò significherebbe che tutti gli utenti (<code>*`\`) come ad esempio </code>jack<code>\</code> possono accedere alla homepage (<code>/`\`). E gli utenti con autorizzazioni di </code>admin<code>\</code> come <code>alice`\` e </code>bob<code>\</code> possono accedere a tutte le pagine e le risorse (come <code>res1`\` e </code>res2<code>\</code>). Inoltre, limitiamo gli utenti senza alcuna autorizzazione di amministratore all'uso solo del metodo di richiesta ``GET<code>\</code>. Per questo scenario, potremmo definire il modello come:</p>

<p>Questo aggiungerà la configurazione dei metadati del plugin alla rotta. Puoi anche facilmente aggiornare la configurazione dei metadati del plugin rispedendo la richiesta ai metadati del plugin con la configurazione del modello e della politica aggiornati, il plugin aggiornerà automaticamente tutte le rotte che utilizzano i metadati del plugin.</p>

<ul>
<li class="">Il caso d'uso principale di questo plugin sarebbe nell'implementazione dell'autorizzazione nelle tue API. Puoi facilmente aggiungere questo plugin su qualsiasi rotta API che stai utilizzando con il tuo modello di autorizzazione e configurazione della politica.</li>
<li class="">Se desideri avere un singolo modello di autorizzazione per tutte le tue API, puoi utilizzare il metodo del modello/politica globale. Questo rende facile l'aggiornamento della politica per tutte le rotte, poiché devi solo aggiornare i metadati in etcd.</li>
<li class="">Mentre se desideri utilizzare un modello diverso per ogni rotta diversa, puoi utilizzare il metodo della rotta. Questo è utile quando diverse route API hanno diversi set di permessi utente. Puoi anche utilizzare questo quando hai a che fare con politiche più grandi, poiché renderà l'autorizzazione più veloce quando filtrata in più route.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alcuni dei nostri clienti chiedono se Casbin può essere utilizzato come servizio invece che come libreria. La risposta è <strong>SÌ</strong>. Oggi, abbiamo lanciato il progetto <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin Server</a> come soluzione concreta per</p>
<p><strong>Casbin Server</strong> è in fase di sviluppo attivo da parte del nostro team principale. Presenta diverse funzionalità:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Sviluppato esclusivamente in Golang.</li>
<li class="">Può gestire migliaia di istanze Casbin, consentendo di spostare la logica di applicazione dei criteri da più servizi in un unico Casbin Server.</li>
<li class=""><strong>gRPC</strong> viene utilizzato per comunicare con Casbin Server. Consideriamo anche di aggiungere il supporto <strong>RESTful</strong> nel prossimo futuro.</li>
<li class="">È fornito un portale amministratore web intuitivo per consentire agli amministratori non sviluppatori di gestire tutti i dettagli come istanze Casbin, modelli, archiviazione dei criteri e bilanciamento del carico.</li>
</ul>
<p>Il codice sorgente è ospitato su GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server</a></p>
