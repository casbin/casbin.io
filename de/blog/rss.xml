            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2024 was the year AI agents went from demos to production. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-world-has-changed">The World Has Changed<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-world-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu The World Has Changed" title="Direkter Link zu The World Has Changed" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.</p>
<p>The MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like <code>mcp:tools:weather</code> or <code>mcp:resources:customer-data:read</code>. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-were-working-on">What We're Working On<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-were-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu What We're Working On" title="Direkter Link zu What We're Working On" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="mcp-server-authorization">MCP Server Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#mcp-server-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu MCP Server Authorization" title="Direkter Link zu MCP Server Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?</p>
<p>Traditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just "is alice an admin" but "is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice's region during business hours." We're exploring how Casbin's policy model can express these constraints naturally.</p>
<p>The challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We're looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="edge-first-authorization">Edge-First Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#edge-first-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu Edge-First Authorization" title="Direkter Link zu Edge-First Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can't afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.</p>
<p>This is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don't have all the answers yet, but it's where things are heading.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they've built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="rag-pipeline-authorization">RAG Pipeline Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#rag-pipeline-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu RAG Pipeline Authorization" title="Direkter Link zu RAG Pipeline Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Here's something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.</p>
<p>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists "Sensitive Information Disclosure" as a major risk. The solution isn't just filtering outputs - it's ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn't have access to in the first place.</p>
<p>This means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We're thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="multi-agent-scenarios">Multi-Agent Scenarios<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#multi-agent-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu Multi-Agent Scenarios" title="Direkter Link zu Multi-Agent Scenarios" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.</p>
<p>The OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for "can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice" needs a proper model. Casbin's support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-traditional-roadmap-stuff">The Traditional Roadmap Stuff<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-traditional-roadmap-stuff" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" title="Direkter Link zu The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Of course, we're not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:</p>
<p><strong>Language implementations catching up</strong> - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The <code>in</code> operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the <code>g</code> function - these need to be consistent everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>New framework middlewares</strong> - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.</p>
<p><strong>Performance work</strong> - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-we-dont-know-yet">What We Don't Know Yet<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-we-dont-know-yet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu What We Don't Know Yet" title="Direkter Link zu What We Don't Know Yet" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Honestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we're learning as we go. Some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Should Casbin have first-class primitives for "agent identity" vs "user identity"?</li>
<li class="">How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?</li>
<li class="">What's the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.</p>

<p>We've been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don't need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>The next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We're excited to figure them out together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the <a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin</a> library. For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="introduction-to-rbac">Introduction to RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#introduction-to-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu Introduction to RBAC" title="Direkter Link zu Introduction to RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let's take a look at Azure's RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac">Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" title="Direkter Link zu Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png" alt="Azure Hierarchy" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There is a role called <strong>Owner</strong> for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the <strong>Owner</strong> role assigned to me at the
subscription level, that means I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
<strong>Owner</strong> at the resource group level, then I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resources under that resource group.</p>
<p>This image shows that I have <strong>Owner</strong> access at the subscription level. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subscription Owner" src="https://casbin.org/de/assets/images/subscription-owner-f1a7e1c9c03d7c587ce910ae5e6d8a35.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited <strong>Owner</strong> access from the
subscription. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="RG Owner" src="https://casbin.org/de/assets/images/rg-owner-9c6cd2ae5997a5fba717c445f43130e6.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So, this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="how-does-casbin-work">How Does Casbin Work?<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#how-does-casbin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu How Does Casbin Work?" title="Direkter Link zu How Does Casbin Work?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-acl">What is ACL?<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-acl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu What is ACL?" title="Direkter Link zu What is ACL?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-model-definition">The model definition<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#the-model-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu The model definition" title="Direkter Link zu The model definition" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider a simple example of an ACL model.</p>
<div class="language-toml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-toml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[request_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">r = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">p = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_effect]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">e = some(where (p.eft == allow))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[matchers]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>request_definition</strong> is the query template of the system. For example, a request <code>alice, write, data1</code> can be
interpreted as "Can subject Alice perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'?".</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_definition</strong> is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy <code>alice, write, data1</code>, you are
assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_effect</strong> defines the effect of the policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>In the <strong>matchers</strong> section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions <code>r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-hierarchical-rbac">What is Hierarchical RBAC?<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu What is Hierarchical RBAC?" title="Direkter Link zu What is Hierarchical RBAC?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, "subscription" is one type and "resourceGroup" is another type. A sub1 of type <strong>Subscription</strong> can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role <strong>sub-owner</strong>. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role <strong>rg-owner</strong>, which means that if I am assigned the <strong>sub-owner</strong> role on Subscription <strong>sub1</strong>, then I automatically also get the <strong>rg-owner</strong> role on <strong>rg1 and rg2</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">APISIX</a> ist ein hochleistungsfähiges und skalierbares natives API Gateway basierend auf Nginx und etc. Es ist ein Open-Source-Projekt der Apache Software Foundation. Außerdem ist das, was APISIX so gut macht, die Unterstützung vieler großartiger Plugins, die verwendet werden könnten, um Funktionen wie Authentifizierung zu implementieren, überwachen, routing, etc. Und die Tatsache, dass Plugins in APISIX heiß neu geladen werden (ohne Neustart) macht es sehr dynamisch.</p>
<p>Bei Verwendung von APISIX kann es jedoch zu Szenarien kommen, bei denen Sie möglicherweise komplexe Autorisierungslogik in Ihrer Anwendung hinzufügen möchten. Hier könnte Ihnen authz-casbin helfen authz-casbin ist ein APISIX-Plugin, das auf <a href="https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lua Casbin</a> basiert, das eine leistungsstarke Autorisierung basierend auf verschiedenen Zugriffskontrollmodellen ermöglicht. <a class="" href="https://casbin.org/de/">Casbin</a> ist eine Autorisierungsbibliothek, die Zugriffskontrollmodelle wie ACL, RBAC, ABAC unterstützt. Ursprünglich in Go geschrieben, wurde es in viele Sprachen portiert und Lua Casbin ist die Lua-Implementierung von Casbin. Die Entwicklung von authz-casbin startete, als wir ein neues Plugin für die Autorisierung im APISIX-Repository (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4674</a>), dem die Kernmitglieder zugestimmt haben, vorschlugen. Und nach den hilfreichen Bewertungen, die zu einigen wesentlichen Änderungen und Verbesserungen geführt haben, wurde die PR (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4710</a>) schließlich zusammengeführt.</p>
<p>In diesem Blog, wir werden das authz-casbin Plugin verwenden, um zu zeigen, wie Sie ein Autorisierungsmodell basierend auf der Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in APISIX implementieren können.</p>
<p><strong>HINWEIS</strong>: Sie müssen ein anderes Plugin oder einen benutzerdefinierten Workflow verwenden, um den Benutzer zu authentifizieren, da Casbin nur die Autorisierung und keine Authentifizierung durchführt.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="erstellen-eines-modells">Erstellen eines Modells<a href="https://casbin.org/de/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#erstellen-eines-modells" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zu Erstellen eines Modells" title="Direkter Link zu Erstellen eines Modells" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Das Plugin verwendet drei Parameter, um jede Anfrage zu autorisieren - Subjekt, Objekt und Aktion. Betreff ist hier der Wert des Benutzernamen-Headers, der so etwas wie <code>[Benutzername: alice]</code> sein könnte. Dann ist das Objekt der URL-Pfad, auf den zugegriffen wird und die Aktion ist die Anfragemethode, die verwendet wird.</p>
<p>Nehmen wir an, wir wollen ein Modell mit drei Ressourcen an den Pfaden erstellen - <code>/</code>, <code>/res1</code> und <code>/res2</code>. Und wir wollen ein Modell wie dies:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="bild" src="https://casbin.org/de/assets/images/model-1c0c2441dd19f8b957744635985283eb.png" width="4520" height="1720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Dies würde bedeuten, dass alle Benutzer (<code>*</code>) wie zum Beispiel <code>jack</code> auf die Homepage zugreifen können (<code>/</code>). Und Benutzer mit <code>admin</code> Berechtigungen wie <code>alice</code> und <code>bob</code> können auf alle Seiten und Ressourcen zugreifen (wie <code>res1</code> und <code>res2</code>). Lass uns Benutzer ohne Administratorrechte auf nur <code>GET</code> Anfragemethode beschränken. Für dieses Szenario könnten wir das Modell definieren als:</p>

<p>Dies wird die Plugin-Metadatenkonfiguration zur Route hinzufügen. Sie können die Metadatenkonfiguration des Plugins auch ganz einfach aktualisieren, indem Sie die Anfrage an die Metadaten des Plugins mit aktualisiertem Modell und Richtlinien-Konfiguration erneut schicken, das Plugin aktualisiert automatisch alle Routen mit dem Plugin Metadata.</p>

<ul>
<li class="">Der primäre Anwendungsfall dieses Plugins wäre die Implementierung der Autorisierung in Ihren APIs. Sie können dieses Plugin ganz einfach auf jeder API-Route hinzufügen, die Sie mit Ihrem Autorisierungsmodell und Ihrer Richtlinien-Konfiguration verwenden.</li>
<li class="">Wenn Sie ein einziges Autorisierungsmodell für alle Ihre APIs haben möchten, können Sie globale Modelle/Richtlinien-Methode verwenden. Dies erleichtert die Aktualisierung der Richtlinie für alle Routen, da Sie nur die Metadaten in etcd aktualisieren müssen.</li>
<li class="">Wenn Sie für jede Route ein anderes Modell verwenden möchten, können Sie die Routenmethode verwenden. Dies ist hilfreich, wenn verschiedene API-Routen unterschiedliche Benutzerberechtigungen haben. Sie können dies auch verwenden, wenn Sie sich mit größeren Richtlinien befassen, da es die Autorisierung beschleunigen wird, wenn Sie in mehrere Routen gefiltert werden.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Einige unserer Kunden fragen, ob Casbin als Service anstelle einer Bibliothek genutzt werden kann. Die Antwort lautet <strong>JA</strong>. Heute haben wir das <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin Server</a> Projekt als konkrete Lösung für <strong>Access Control as a Service</strong> gestartet.</p>
<p><strong>Casbin Server</strong> wird von unserem Kernteam aktiv weiterentwickelt. Es hat mehrere Eigenschaften:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Rein entwickelt in Golang.</li>
<li class="">Kann tausende Casbin-Instanzen verwalten, so dass Sie die Logik der Durchsetzung von Richtlinien von mehreren Diensten auf einen Casbin-Server umstellen können.</li>
<li class=""><strong>gRPC</strong> wird verwendet, um mit Casbin Server zu kommunizieren. Wir erwägen auch, in naher Zukunft den <strong>RESTful</strong> Support hinzuzufügen.</li>
<li class="">Ein benutzerfreundliches Web-Administratorportal für nicht-Entwickler Administratoren zur Verwaltung aller Details wie Casbin-Instanzen, Modelle, Richtlinienspeicherung und Lastausgleich.</li>
</ul>
<p>Der Quellcode wird auf GitHub gehostet: <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server</a></p>
