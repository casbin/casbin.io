            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2024 was the year AI agents went from demos to production. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-world-has-changed">The World Has Changed<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-world-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke The World Has Changed" title="Pautan terus ke The World Has Changed" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.</p>
<p>The MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like <code>mcp:tools:weather</code> or <code>mcp:resources:customer-data:read</code>. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-were-working-on">What We're Working On<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-were-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke What We're Working On" title="Pautan terus ke What We're Working On" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="mcp-server-authorization">MCP Server Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#mcp-server-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke MCP Server Authorization" title="Pautan terus ke MCP Server Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?</p>
<p>Traditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just "is alice an admin" but "is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice's region during business hours." We're exploring how Casbin's policy model can express these constraints naturally.</p>
<p>The challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We're looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="edge-first-authorization">Edge-First Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#edge-first-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke Edge-First Authorization" title="Pautan terus ke Edge-First Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can't afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.</p>
<p>This is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don't have all the answers yet, but it's where things are heading.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they've built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="rag-pipeline-authorization">RAG Pipeline Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#rag-pipeline-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke RAG Pipeline Authorization" title="Pautan terus ke RAG Pipeline Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Here's something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.</p>
<p>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists "Sensitive Information Disclosure" as a major risk. The solution isn't just filtering outputs - it's ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn't have access to in the first place.</p>
<p>This means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We're thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="multi-agent-scenarios">Multi-Agent Scenarios<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#multi-agent-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke Multi-Agent Scenarios" title="Pautan terus ke Multi-Agent Scenarios" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.</p>
<p>The OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for "can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice" needs a proper model. Casbin's support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-traditional-roadmap-stuff">The Traditional Roadmap Stuff<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-traditional-roadmap-stuff" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" title="Pautan terus ke The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Of course, we're not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:</p>
<p><strong>Language implementations catching up</strong> - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The <code>in</code> operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the <code>g</code> function - these need to be consistent everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>New framework middlewares</strong> - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.</p>
<p><strong>Performance work</strong> - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-we-dont-know-yet">What We Don't Know Yet<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-we-dont-know-yet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke What We Don't Know Yet" title="Pautan terus ke What We Don't Know Yet" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Honestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we're learning as we go. Some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Should Casbin have first-class primitives for "agent identity" vs "user identity"?</li>
<li class="">How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?</li>
<li class="">What's the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.</p>

<p>We've been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don't need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>The next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We're excited to figure them out together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the <a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin</a> library. For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="introduction-to-rbac">Introduction to RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#introduction-to-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke Introduction to RBAC" title="Pautan terus ke Introduction to RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let's take a look at Azure's RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac">Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" title="Pautan terus ke Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png" alt="Azure Hierarchy" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There is a role called <strong>Owner</strong> for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the <strong>Owner</strong> role assigned to me at the
subscription level, that means I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
<strong>Owner</strong> at the resource group level, then I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resources under that resource group.</p>
<p>This image shows that I have <strong>Owner</strong> access at the subscription level. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subscription Owner" src="https://casbin.org/ms/assets/images/subscription-owner-f1a7e1c9c03d7c587ce910ae5e6d8a35.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited <strong>Owner</strong> access from the
subscription. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="RG Owner" src="https://casbin.org/ms/assets/images/rg-owner-9c6cd2ae5997a5fba717c445f43130e6.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So, this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="how-does-casbin-work">How Does Casbin Work?<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#how-does-casbin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke How Does Casbin Work?" title="Pautan terus ke How Does Casbin Work?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-acl">What is ACL?<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-acl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke What is ACL?" title="Pautan terus ke What is ACL?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-model-definition">The model definition<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#the-model-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke The model definition" title="Pautan terus ke The model definition" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider a simple example of an ACL model.</p>
<div class="language-toml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-toml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[request_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">r = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">p = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_effect]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">e = some(where (p.eft == allow))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[matchers]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>request_definition</strong> is the query template of the system. For example, a request <code>alice, write, data1</code> can be
interpreted as "Can subject Alice perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'?".</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_definition</strong> is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy <code>alice, write, data1</code>, you are
assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_effect</strong> defines the effect of the policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>In the <strong>matchers</strong> section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions <code>r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-hierarchical-rbac">What is Hierarchical RBAC?<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke What is Hierarchical RBAC?" title="Pautan terus ke What is Hierarchical RBAC?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, "subscription" is one type and "resourceGroup" is another type. A sub1 of type <strong>Subscription</strong> can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role <strong>sub-owner</strong>. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role <strong>rg-owner</strong>, which means that if I am assigned the <strong>sub-owner</strong> role on Subscription <strong>sub1</strong>, then I automatically also get the <strong>rg-owner</strong> role on <strong>rg1 and rg2</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">APISIX</a> ialah gerbang API berasaskan awan yang berkelajuan tinggi dan boleh diubah suai yang berdasarkan Nginx dan etcd. Ia adalah projek sumber terbuka oleh Yayasan Perisian Apache. Selain itu, apa yang menjadikan APISIX begitu baik ialah sokongan untuk banyak plugin terbina dalam yang hebat yang boleh digunakan untuk melaksanakan ciri-ciri seperti pengesahan, pemantauan, perutean, dsb. Dan hakikat bahawa plugin dalam APISIX dimuat semula secara panas (tanpa mula semula) menjadikannya sangat dinamik.</p>
<p>Tetapi semasa menggunakan APISIX, mungkin terdapat senario di mana anda mungkin ingin menambah logik kebenaran kompleks dalam aplikasi anda. Inilah di mana authz-casbin mungkin boleh membantu anda, authz-casbin adalah plugin APISIX yang berdasarkan <a href="https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lua Casbin</a> yang membolehkan penggunaan kuasa penggunaan berdasarkan pelbagai model kawalan akses. <a class="" href="https://casbin.org/ms/">Casbin</a> adalah perpustakaan penggunaan yang menyokong model kawalan akses seperti ACL, RBAC, ABAC. Asalnya ditulis dalam Go, ia telah dipindahkan ke banyak bahasa dan Lua Casbin adalah pelaksanaan Lua bagi Casbin. Pembangunan authz-casbin bermula apabila kami mencadangkan plugin baru untuk penggunaan dalam repositori APISIX (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4674</a>) yang mana ahli teras bersetuju. Dan selepas ulasan yang membantu yang menyebabkan beberapa perubahan dan penambahbaikan utama, PR (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4710</a>) akhirnya digabungkan.</p>
<p>Dalam blog ini, kami akan menggunakan plugin authz-casbin untuk menunjukkan bagaimana anda boleh melaksanakan model penggunaan berdasarkan Kawalan Akses Berdasarkan Peranan (RBAC) dalam APISIX.</p>
<p><strong>PERHATIAN</strong>: Anda perlu menggunakan beberapa plugin lain atau alur kerja tersuai untuk mengesahkan pengguna kerana Casbin hanya akan melakukan penggunaan dan bukan pengesahan.</p>

<p>Plugin ini menggunakan tiga parameter untuk membenarkan sebarang permintaan - subjek, objek dan tindakan. Di sini, subjek adalah nilai tajuk nama pengguna, yang boleh menjadi seperti <code>[username: alice]</code>. Kemudian, objek tersebut adalah laluan URL yang diakses dan tindakan adalah kaedah permintaan yang digunakan.</p>
<p>Katakan kita ingin membuat model dengan tiga sumber pada laluan - <code>/`\`, </code>/res1<code>\</code> dan ``/res2<code>\</code>. Dan kita ingin mempunyai model seperti ini:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="imej" src="https://casbin.org/ms/assets/images/model-1c0c2441dd19f8b957744635985283eb.png" width="4520" height="1720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Ini bermakna semua pengguna (<code>*`\`) seperti contohnya </code>jack<code>\</code> boleh mengakses laman utama (<code>/`\`). Dan pengguna dengan kebenaran </code>admin<code>\</code> seperti <code>alice`\` dan </code>bob<code>\</code> boleh mengakses semua halaman dan sumber (seperti <code>res1`\` dan </code>res2<code>\</code>). Juga, mari kita hadkan pengguna tanpa sebarang kebenaran admin untuk menggunakan hanya kaedah permintaan ``GET<code>\</code>. Untuk senario ini, kita boleh menentukan model sebagai:</p>

<p>Ini akan menambah konfigurasi metadata plugin ke rute tersebut.

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="kes-penggunaan">Kes Penggunaan<a href="https://casbin.org/ms/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#kes-penggunaan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Pautan terus ke Kes Penggunaan" title="Pautan terus ke Kes Penggunaan" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class="">Kes penggunaan utama plugin ini adalah dalam melaksanakan kebenaran dalam API anda. Anda boleh menambah plugin ini dengan mudah pada mana-mana rute API yang anda gunakan dengan konfigurasi model dan polisi kebenaran anda.</li>
<li class="">Jika anda ingin mempunyai model kebenaran tunggal untuk semua API anda, anda boleh menggunakan kaedah model/polisi global. Ini memudahkan pengemaskinian polisi untuk semua rute, kerana anda hanya perlu mengemas kini metadata dalam etcd.</li>
<li class="">Manakala jika anda ingin menggunakan model yang berbeza untuk setiap rute yang berbeza, anda boleh menggunakan kaedah rute. Ini berguna apabila laluan API yang berbeza mempunyai set kebenaran pengguna yang berbeza. Anda juga boleh menggunakan ini apabila anda menangani dasar yang lebih besar, kerana ia akan mempercepatkan pengesahan apabila disaring ke dalam pelbagai laluan.</li>
