        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2024 was the year AI agents went from demos to production. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-world-has-changed">The World Has Changed<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-world-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers The World Has Changed" title="Lien direct vers The World Has Changed" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.</p>
<p>The MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like <code>mcp:tools:weather</code> or <code>mcp:resources:customer-data:read</code>. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-were-working-on">What We're Working On<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-were-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What We're Working On" title="Lien direct vers What We're Working On" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="mcp-server-authorization">MCP Server Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#mcp-server-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers MCP Server Authorization" title="Lien direct vers MCP Server Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?</p>
<p>Traditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just "is alice an admin" but "is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice's region during business hours." We're exploring how Casbin's policy model can express these constraints naturally.</p>
<p>The challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We're looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="edge-first-authorization">Edge-First Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#edge-first-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Edge-First Authorization" title="Lien direct vers Edge-First Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can't afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.</p>
<p>This is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don't have all the answers yet, but it's where things are heading.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they've built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="rag-pipeline-authorization">RAG Pipeline Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#rag-pipeline-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers RAG Pipeline Authorization" title="Lien direct vers RAG Pipeline Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Here's something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.</p>
<p>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists "Sensitive Information Disclosure" as a major risk. The solution isn't just filtering outputs - it's ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn't have access to in the first place.</p>
<p>This means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We're thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="multi-agent-scenarios">Multi-Agent Scenarios<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#multi-agent-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Multi-Agent Scenarios" title="Lien direct vers Multi-Agent Scenarios" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.</p>
<p>The OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for "can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice" needs a proper model. Casbin's support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-traditional-roadmap-stuff">The Traditional Roadmap Stuff<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-traditional-roadmap-stuff" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" title="Lien direct vers The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Of course, we're not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:</p>
<p><strong>Language implementations catching up</strong> - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The <code>in</code> operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the <code>g</code> function - these need to be consistent everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>New framework middlewares</strong> - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.</p>
<p><strong>Performance work</strong> - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-we-dont-know-yet">What We Don't Know Yet<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-we-dont-know-yet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What We Don't Know Yet" title="Lien direct vers What We Don't Know Yet" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Honestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we're learning as we go. Some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Should Casbin have first-class primitives for "agent identity" vs "user identity"?</li>
<li class="">How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?</li>
<li class="">What's the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.</p>

<p>We've been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don't need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>The next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We're excited to figure them out together.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the <a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin</a> library. For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.</p>

<p>RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let's take a look at Azure's RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac">Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" title="Lien direct vers Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png" alt="Azure Hierarchy" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There is a role called <strong>Owner</strong> for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the <strong>Owner</strong> role assigned to me at the
subscription level, that means I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
<strong>Owner</strong> at the resource group level, then I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resources under that resource group.</p>
<p>This image shows that I have <strong>Owner</strong> access at the subscription level. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subscription Owner" src="https://casbin.org/fr/assets/images/subscription-owner-f1a7e1c9c03d7c587ce910ae5e6d8a35.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited <strong>Owner</strong> access from the
subscription. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="RG Owner" src="https://casbin.org/fr/assets/images/rg-owner-9c6cd2ae5997a5fba717c445f43130e6.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So, this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="how-does-casbin-work">How Does Casbin Work?<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#how-does-casbin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers How Does Casbin Work?" title="Lien direct vers How Does Casbin Work?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-acl">What is ACL?<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-acl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What is ACL?" title="Lien direct vers What is ACL?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-model-definition">The model definition<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#the-model-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers The model definition" title="Lien direct vers The model definition" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider a simple example of an ACL model.</p>
<div class="language-toml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-toml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[request_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">r = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">p = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_effect]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">e = some(where (p.eft == allow))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[matchers]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>request_definition</strong> is the query template of the system. For example, a request <code>alice, write, data1</code> can be
interpreted as "Can subject Alice perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'?".</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_definition</strong> is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy <code>alice, write, data1</code>, you are
assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_effect</strong> defines the effect of the policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>In the <strong>matchers</strong> section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions <code>r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-hierarchical-rbac">What is Hierarchical RBAC?<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What is Hierarchical RBAC?" title="Lien direct vers What is Hierarchical RBAC?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, "subscription" is one type and "resourceGroup" is another type. A sub1 of type <strong>Subscription</strong> can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role <strong>sub-owner</strong>. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role <strong>rg-owner</strong>, which means that if I am assigned the <strong>sub-owner</strong> role on Subscription <strong>sub1</strong>, then I automatically also get the <strong>rg-owner</strong> role on <strong>rg1 and rg2</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">APISIX</a> is a high performance and scalable cloud native API gateway based on Nginx and etcd. It is an open source project by the Apache Software Foundation. Besides that, what makes APISIX so good is the support of many great built in plugins that could be used to implement features like authentication, monitoring, routing, etc. And the fact that plugins in APISIX are hot-reloaded (without restarts) makes it very dynamic.</p>
<p>But while using APISIX, there may be scenarios where you might want to add complex authorization logic in your application. This is where authz-casbin might help you, authz-casbin is an APISIX plugin based on <a href="https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lua Casbin</a> that enables powerful authorization based on various access control models. <a class="" href="https://casbin.org/fr/">Casbin</a> is an authorization library which supports access control models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC. Originally written in Go, it has been ported to many languages and Lua Casbin is the Lua implementation of Casbin. The development of authz-casbin started when we proposed a new plugin for authorization in the APISIX repository (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4674</a>) to which the core members agreed. And after the helpful reviews which led to some major changes and improvements, the PR (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4710</a>) was finally merged.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will use the authz-casbin plugin to show how you can implement an authorization model based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in APISIX.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You will need to use some other plugin or custom workflow for authenticating the user since Casbin will only do authorization and not authentication.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="creating-a-model">Creating a model<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#creating-a-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Creating a model" title="Lien direct vers Creating a model" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The plugin uses three parameters for authorizing any request - subject, object and action. Here, subject is the value of  the username header, which could be something like <code>[username: alice]</code>. Then, the object is the URL path that is being accessed and the action is request method being used.</p>
<p>Let's say we want to create a model with three resources at the paths - <code>/</code>, <code>/res1</code> and <code>/res2</code>. And we want to have a model like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="image" src="https://casbin.org/fr/assets/images/model-1c0c2441dd19f8b957744635985283eb.png" width="4520" height="1720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This would mean that all users (<code>*</code>) like for example <code>jack</code> can access the homepage (<code>/</code>). And users with <code>admin</code> permissions like <code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code> can access all the pages and resources (like <code>res1</code> and <code>res2</code>). Also, let's restrict users without any admin permissions to using only <code>GET</code> request method. For this scenario, we could define the model as:</p>

<p>There may be situations where you might want to use a single model and policy configuration across multiple routes. You can do that by first by sending a <code>PUT</code> request to add the model and policy configuration to the plugin's metadata by:</p>

<p>This will add the plugin metadata configuration to the route. You can also easily update the plugin metadata configuration by resending the request to plugin's metadata with updated model and policy configuration, the plugin will automatically update all the routes using the plugin metadata.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="use-cases">Use Cases<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#use-cases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Use Cases" title="Lien direct vers Use Cases" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class="">The primary use case of this plugin would be in implementing authorization in your APIs. You can easily add this plugin on any API route that you are using with your authorization model and policy configuration.</li>
<li class="">If you want to have a single authorization model for all your APIs, you can use global model/policy method. This makes updating the policy easy for all routes, since you only need to update the metadata in etcd.</li>
<li class="">While if you would like to use a different model for every different route, you can use the route method. This is helpful when different API routes have different sets of user permissions. You can also use this when you are dealing with larger policies, since it will make the authorization faster when filtered into multiple routes.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of our customers ask if Casbin can be used as a service instead of a library. The
answer is <strong>YES</strong>. Today, we launched the <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin Server</a> project as a concrete solution for
<strong>Access Control as a Service</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Casbin Server</strong> is under active development by our core team. It has several features:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Purely developed in Golang.</li>
<li class="">Can manage thousands of Casbin instances, so you can move policy enforcement logic from multiple services into one Casbin Server.</li>
<li class=""><strong>gRPC</strong> is used to communicated with Casbin Server. We also consider to add the <strong>RESTful</strong> support in near future.</li>
<li class="">A friendly web administrator portal is provided for non-developer administrators to manage all details like Casbin instances, models, policy storage and load balancing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code is hosted on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server</a></p>
