        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2024 was the year AI agents went from demos to production. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-world-has-changed">The World Has Changed<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-world-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers The World Has Changed" title="Lien direct vers The World Has Changed" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.</p>
<p>The MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like <code>mcp:tools:weather</code> or <code>mcp:resources:customer-data:read</code>. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-were-working-on">What We're Working On<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-were-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What We're Working On" title="Lien direct vers What We're Working On" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="mcp-server-authorization">MCP Server Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#mcp-server-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers MCP Server Authorization" title="Lien direct vers MCP Server Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?</p>
<p>Traditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just "is alice an admin" but "is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice's region during business hours." We're exploring how Casbin's policy model can express these constraints naturally.</p>
<p>The challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We're looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="edge-first-authorization">Edge-First Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#edge-first-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Edge-First Authorization" title="Lien direct vers Edge-First Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can't afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.</p>
<p>This is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don't have all the answers yet, but it's where things are heading.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they've built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="rag-pipeline-authorization">RAG Pipeline Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#rag-pipeline-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers RAG Pipeline Authorization" title="Lien direct vers RAG Pipeline Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Here's something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.</p>
<p>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists "Sensitive Information Disclosure" as a major risk. The solution isn't just filtering outputs - it's ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn't have access to in the first place.</p>
<p>This means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We're thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="multi-agent-scenarios">Multi-Agent Scenarios<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#multi-agent-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Multi-Agent Scenarios" title="Lien direct vers Multi-Agent Scenarios" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.</p>
<p>The OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for "can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice" needs a proper model. Casbin's support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-traditional-roadmap-stuff">The Traditional Roadmap Stuff<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-traditional-roadmap-stuff" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" title="Lien direct vers The Traditional Roadmap Stuff" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Of course, we're not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:</p>
<p><strong>Language implementations catching up</strong> - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The <code>in</code> operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the <code>g</code> function - these need to be consistent everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>New framework middlewares</strong> - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.</p>
<p><strong>Performance work</strong> - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-we-dont-know-yet">What We Don't Know Yet<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-we-dont-know-yet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What We Don't Know Yet" title="Lien direct vers What We Don't Know Yet" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Honestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we're learning as we go. Some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Should Casbin have first-class primitives for "agent identity" vs "user identity"?</li>
<li class="">How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?</li>
<li class="">What's the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.</p>

<p>We've been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don't need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>The next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We're excited to figure them out together.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the <a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin</a> library. For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.</p>

<p>RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let's take a look at Azure's RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac">Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" title="Lien direct vers Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png" alt="Azure Hierarchy" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There is a role called <strong>Owner</strong> for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the <strong>Owner</strong> role assigned to me at the
subscription level, that means I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
<strong>Owner</strong> at the resource group level, then I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resources under that resource group.</p>
<p>This image shows that I have <strong>Owner</strong> access at the subscription level. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subscription Owner" src="https://casbin.org/fr/assets/images/subscription-owner-f1a7e1c9c03d7c587ce910ae5e6d8a35.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited <strong>Owner</strong> access from the
subscription. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="RG Owner" src="https://casbin.org/fr/assets/images/rg-owner-9c6cd2ae5997a5fba717c445f43130e6.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So, this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="how-does-casbin-work">How Does Casbin Work?<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#how-does-casbin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers How Does Casbin Work?" title="Lien direct vers How Does Casbin Work?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-acl">What is ACL?<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-acl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What is ACL?" title="Lien direct vers What is ACL?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-model-definition">The model definition<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#the-model-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers The model definition" title="Lien direct vers The model definition" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider a simple example of an ACL model.</p>
<div class="language-toml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-toml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[request_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">r = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">p = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_effect]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">e = some(where (p.eft == allow))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[matchers]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>request_definition</strong> is the query template of the system. For example, a request <code>alice, write, data1</code> can be
interpreted as "Can subject Alice perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'?".</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_definition</strong> is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy <code>alice, write, data1</code>, you are
assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_effect</strong> defines the effect of the policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>In the <strong>matchers</strong> section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions <code>r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-hierarchical-rbac">What is Hierarchical RBAC?<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What is Hierarchical RBAC?" title="Lien direct vers What is Hierarchical RBAC?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, "subscription" is one type and "resourceGroup" is another type. A sub1 of type <strong>Subscription</strong> can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role <strong>sub-owner</strong>. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role <strong>rg-owner</strong>, which means that if I am assigned the <strong>sub-owner</strong> role on Subscription <strong>sub1</strong>, then I automatically also get the <strong>rg-owner</strong> role on <strong>rg1 and rg2</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">APISIX</a> est une passerelle native de nuage haute performance et évolutive basée sur Nginx et etcd. C'est un projet open source de la Fondation du logiciel Apache. En plus de cela, ce qui rend APISIX si bon est le support de nombreux plugins qui pourraient être utilisés pour implémenter des fonctionnalités comme l'authentification, surveillance, routage, etc. Et le fait que les plugins d'APISIX soient rechargés à chaud (sans redémarrage) le rend très dynamique.</p>
<p>Mais lorsque vous utilisez APISIX, il peut y avoir des scénarios où vous pourriez vouloir ajouter une logique d'autorisation complexe dans votre application. C'est là que authz-casbin pourrait vous aider, authz-casbin est un plugin APISIX basé sur <a href="https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lua Casbin</a> qui permet une autorisation puissante basée sur différents modèles de contrôle d'accès. <a class="" href="https://casbin.org/fr/">Casbin</a> est une bibliothèque d'autorisation qui prend en charge les modèles de contrôle d'accès comme ACL, RBAC, ABAC. Initialement écrit en Go, il a été porté dans de nombreuses langues et Lua Casbin est l'implémentation Lua de Casbin. Le développement de authz-casbin a commencé quand nous avons proposé un nouveau plugin d'autorisation dans le dépôt APISIX (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4674</a>) auquel les membres du noyau se sont mis d'accord. Et après les critiques utiles qui ont conduit à des changements et améliorations majeurs, le PR (<a bref="https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710">#4710</a>) a finalement été fusionné.</p>
<p>Dans ce blog, nous utiliserons le plugin authz-casbin pour montrer comment vous pouvez implémenter un modèle d'autorisation basé sur le contrôle d'accès basé sur les rôles (RBAC) dans APISIX.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Vous devrez utiliser un autre plugin ou un workflow personnalisé pour l'authentification de l'utilisateur puisque Casbin ne fera que l'autorisation et non l'authentification.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="création-dun-modèle">Création d'un modèle<a href="https://casbin.org/fr/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#cr%C3%A9ation-dun-mod%C3%A8le" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Création d'un modèle" title="Lien direct vers Création d'un modèle" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Le plugin utilise trois paramètres pour autoriser toute requête - sujet, objet et action. Ici, le sujet est la valeur de l'en-tête du nom d'utilisateur, qui pourrait être quelque chose comme <code>[username: alice]</code>. Ensuite, l'objet est le chemin URL auquel on accède et l'action est la méthode de requête utilisée.</p>
<p>Disons que nous voulons créer un modèle avec trois ressources dans les chemins - <code>/</code>, <code>/res1</code> et <code>/res2</code>. Et nous voulons avoir un modèle comme celui-ci :</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="image" src="https://casbin.org/fr/assets/images/model-1c0c2441dd19f8b957744635985283eb.png" width="4520" height="1720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Cela signifierait que tous les utilisateurs (<code>*</code>) comme par exemple <code>jack</code> peuvent accéder à la page d'accueil (<code>/</code>). Et les utilisateurs avec les permissions <code>admin</code> comme <code>alice</code> et <code>bob</code> peuvent accéder à toutes les pages et toutes les ressources (comme <code>res1</code> et <code>res2</code>). Aussi, limitons les utilisateurs qui n'ont pas les permissions d'administration à utiliser uniquement la méthode de requête <code>GET</code>. Pour ce scénario, nous pourrions définir le modèle comme:</p>

<p>Ceci ajoutera la configuration des métadonnées du plugin à la route.

<li class="">Le cas d'utilisation principal de ce plugin serait l'implémentation de l'autorisation dans vos API. Vous pouvez facilement ajouter ce plugin sur n'importe quelle route API que vous utilisez avec votre modèle d'autorisation et la configuration de la politique.</li>
<li class="">Si vous voulez avoir un modèle d'autorisation unique pour toutes vos API, vous pouvez utiliser la méthode du modèle global. Cela rend la mise à jour de la politique facile pour tous les itinéraires, car vous n'avez qu'à mettre à jour les métadonnées dans etcd.</li>
<li class="">Si vous souhaitez utiliser un modèle différent pour chaque itinéraire, vous pouvez utiliser la méthode de l'itinéraire. Ceci est utile lorsque les différentes routes de l'API ont différents ensembles de permissions d'utilisateur. Vous pouvez également utiliser cela lorsque vous avez affaire à des politiques plus importantes, car cela rendra l’autorisation plus rapide lorsque filtrée sur plusieurs routes.</li>

Aujourd'hui, nous avons lancé le projet <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin Server</a> en tant que solution concrète pour <strong>Le contrôle d'accès en tant que service</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Le serveur Casbin</strong> est en cours de développement par notre équipe de base. Il a plusieurs caractéristiques :</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Purement développé à Golang.</li>
<li class="">Peut gérer des milliers d'instances Casbin, de sorte que vous pouvez déplacer la logique d'application de la politique de plusieurs services vers un seul serveur Casbin.</li>
<li class=""><strong>gRPC</strong> est utilisé pour communiquer avec le serveur Casbin. Nous envisageons également d'ajouter le support <strong>RESTful</strong> dans un avenir proche.</li>
<li class="">Un portail administrateur web convivial est fourni aux administrateurs non-développeurs pour gérer tous les détails tels que les instances, les modèles, les politiques de stockage et l'équilibrage de charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Le code source est hébergé sur GitHub : <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server</a></p>
