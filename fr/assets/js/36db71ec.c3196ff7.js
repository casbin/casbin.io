With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we\'re seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The World Has Changed\\n\\nWhen we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.\\n\\nThe MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like `mcp:tools:weather` or `mcp:resources:customer-data:read`. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.\\n\\n## What We\'re Working On\\n\\n### MCP Server Authorization\\n\\nThis is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?\\n\\nTraditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just \\"is alice an admin\\" but \\"is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice\'s region during business hours.\\" We\'re exploring how Casbin\'s policy model can express these constraints naturally.\\n\\nThe challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We\'re looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.\\n\\n### Edge-First Authorization\\n\\nCloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can\'t afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.\\n\\nThis is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don\'t have all the answers yet, but it\'s where things are heading.\\n\\nWe\'re particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they\'ve built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.\\n\\n### RAG Pipeline Authorization\\n\\nHere\'s something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.\\n\\nThe OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists \\"Sensitive Information Disclosure\\" as a major risk. The solution isn\'t just filtering outputs - it\'s ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn\'t have access to in the first place.\\n\\nThis means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We\'re thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.\\n\\n### Multi-Agent Scenarios\\n\\nWhen you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.\\n\\nThe OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for \\"can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice\\" needs a proper model. Casbin\'s support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.\\n\\n## The Traditional Roadmap Stuff\\n\\nOf course, we\'re not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:\\n\\n**Language implementations catching up** - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The `in` operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the `g` function - these need to be consistent everywhere.\\n\\n**New framework middlewares** - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.\\n\\n**Performance work** - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.\\n\\n## What We Don\'t Know Yet\\n\\nHonestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we\'re learning as we go. Some open questions:\\n\\n- Should Casbin have first-class primitives for \\"agent identity\\" vs \\"user identity\\"?\\n- How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?\\n- What\'s the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?\\n\\nIf you\'re building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.\\n\\n## Getting Involved\\n\\nWe\'ve been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don\'t need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.\\n\\nThe next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We\'re excited to figure them out together."},{"id":"/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-12-08-understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail.md","source":"@site/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-12-08-understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail.md","title":"Understanding How Casbin Matching Works in Detail","description":"In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the Casbin library.

For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.\\n\\n## Introduction to RBAC\\n\\nRBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let\'s take a look at Azure\'s RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.\\n\\n## Understanding Azure\'s Hierarchical RBAC\\n\\n![Azure Hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png)\\n\\nThere is a role called **Owner** for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the **Owner** role assigned to me at the\\nsubscription level, that means I am the **Owner** of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have\\n**Owner** at the resource group level, then I am the **Owner** of all the resources under that resource group.\\n\\nThis image shows that I have **Owner** access at the subscription level. ![Subscription Owner](/img/tutorial/subscription-owner.png)\\n\\nWhen I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited **Owner** access from the\\nsubscription. ![RG Owner](/img/tutorial/rg-owner.png)\\n\\nSo, this is how Azure\'s RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical\\nnature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we\'ll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.\\n\\n## How Does Casbin Work?\\n\\nBefore diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.\\n\\n## What is ACL?\\n\\nACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s consider a simple example of an ACL model.\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act\\n```\\n\\n1. The **request_definition** is the query template of the system. For example, a request `alice, write, data1` can be\\n   interpreted as \\"Can subject Alice perform the action \'write\' on object \'data1\'?\\".\\n\\n2. The **policy_definition** is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy `alice, write, data1`, you are\\n   assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action \'write\' on object \'data1\'.\\n\\n3. The **policy_effect** defines the effect of the policy.\\n\\n4. In the **matchers** section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions `r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act`.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, read, data1\\np, bob, write, data2\\n```\\n\\nand the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, read, data1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the ACL model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![acl](/img/tutorial/acl.png)\\n\\n## What is RBAC?\\n\\nRBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s consider a simple example RBAC model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\ng2 = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && r.obj == p.obj\\n```\\n\\n1. The **role_definition** is a graph relation builder that uses a Graph to compare the request object with the policy object.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, reader, data1\\np, bob, owner, data2\\n\\ng, reader, read\\ng, owner, read\\ng, owner, write\\n```\\n\\nand the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, read, data1\\nalice, write, data1\\nbob, write, data2\\nbob, read, data2\\nbob, write, data1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\nfalse\\ntrue\\ntrue\\nfalse\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![rbac](/img/tutorial/rbac.png)\\n\\nThe **g - Role to action mapping** table has a Graph mapping the role to action. This Graph can be coded as a list of edges, as shown in the policy which is a common way of representing a Graph:\\n\\n```csv\\ng, reader, read\\ng, owner, read\\ng, owner, write\\n```\\n\\n:::info\\n\\n**p** indicates a normal policy that can be compared using the **==** operator. **g** is a Graph-based comparison function. You can define multiple Graph comparators by adding a numerical suffix like **g, g2, g3, ...** and so on.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## What is Hierarchical RBAC?\\n\\nIn Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, \\"subscription\\" is one type and \\"resourceGroup\\" is another type. A sub1 of type **Subscription** can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type **ResourceGroup**.\\n\\nSimilar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role **sub-owner**. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role **rg-owner**, which means that if I am assigned the **sub-owner** role on Subscription **sub1**, then I automatically also get the **rg-owner** role on **rg1 and rg2**.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s take a simple example of the **Hierarchical RBAC** model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\ng2 = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && g2(p.obj, r.obj)\\n```\\n\\n1. The **role_definition** is a graph relation builder which uses a Graph to compare the request object with the policy object.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, sub-reader, sub1\\np, bob, rg-owner, rg2\\n\\n// subscription role to subscription action mapping\\ng, sub-reader, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-write\\n\\n// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping\\ng, rg-reader, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-write\\n\\n// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping\\ng, sub-reader, rg-reader\\ng, sub-owner, rg-owner\\n\\n// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping\\ng2, sub1, rg1\\ng2, sub2, rg2\\n```\\n\\nAnd paste the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, rg-read, rg1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![hrbac](/img/tutorial/hrbac.png)\\n\\nThe **g - Role to (Action, Role) Mapping** table has a graph mapping the role to the action, role mapping. This graph can be coded as a list of edges, as shown in the policy, which is a common way of representing a graph:\\n\\n```csv\\n// subscription role to subscription action mapping\\ng, sub-reader, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-write\\n\\n// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping\\ng, rg-reader, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-write\\n\\n// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping\\ng, sub-reader, rg-reader\\ng, sub-owner, rg-owner\\n```\\n\\nThe **g2 - Sub to RG Mapping** table has a graph mapping subscription to resourceGroup:\\n\\n```csv\\n// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping\\ng2, sub1, rg1\\ng2, sub2, rg2\\n```\\n\\n#### Subject Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-sub-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-sub-match.png)\\n\\n#### Action Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-act-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-act-match.png)\\n\\n#### Object Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-obj-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-obj-match.png)\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nWhen a request is submitted to Casbin, this matching happens for all the policies. If at least one policy matches, then the result of the request is true. If no policy matches the request, then the result is false.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we learned about how different authorization models work and how they can be modeled using Casbin. In the second part of this tutorial, we will implement this in a demo Spring Boot Application and secure the APIs using Casbin."},{"id":"/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-08-19-apisix-casbin-authorization.md","source":"@site/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-08-19-apisix-casbin-authorization.md","title":"Autorisation dans APISIX \xe0 l\'aide de Casbin","description":"Introduction","date":"2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":6.05,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Rushikesh Tote","title":"Membre de Casbin","url":"http://github.com/rushitote","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/rushitote","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Autorisation dans APISIX \xe0 l\'aide de Casbin","author":"Rushikesh Tote","authorTitle":"Membre de Casbin","authorURL":"http://github.com/rushitote","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/rushitote"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding How Casbin Matching Works in Detail","permalink":"/fr/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail"},"nextItem":{"title":"Yang Luo - Gagnant du bonus Google Open Source par les pairs","permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/04/21/google-award"}},"content":"## Introduction\\n\\n[APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/) est une passerelle native de nuage haute performance et \xe9volutive bas\xe9e sur Nginx et etcd.

Initialement \xe9crit en Go, il a \xe9t\xe9 port\xe9 dans de nombreuses langues et Lua Casbin est l\'impl\xe9mentation Lua de Casbin. Le d\xe9veloppement de authz-casbin a commenc\xe9 quand nous avons propos\xe9 un nouveau plugin d\'autorisation dans le d\xe9p\xf4t APISIX ([#4674](https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674)) auquel les membres du noyau se sont mis d\'accord.

Ici, le sujet est la valeur de l\'en-t\xeate du nom d\'utilisateur, qui pourrait \xeatre quelque chose comme `[username: alice]`. Ensuite, l\'objet est le chemin URL auquel on acc\xe8de et l\'action est la m\xe9thode de requ\xeate utilis\xe9e.\\n\\nDisons que nous voulons cr\xe9er un mod\xe8le avec trois ressources dans les chemins - `/`, `/res1` et `/res2`. Et nous voulons avoir un mod\xe8le comme celui-ci :\\n\\n![image](/img/blog/model.png)\\n\\nCela signifierait que tous les utilisateurs (`*`) comme par exemple `jack` peuvent acc\xe9der \xe0 la page d\'accueil (`/`). Et les utilisateurs avec les permissions `admin` comme `alice` et `bob` peuvent acc\xe9der \xe0 toutes les pages et toutes les ressources (comme `res1` et `res2`). Aussi, limitons les utilisateurs qui n\'ont pas les permissions d\'administration \xe0 utiliser uniquement la m\xe9thode de requ\xeate `GET`. Pour ce sc\xe9nario, nous pourrions d\xe9finir le mod\xe8le comme:\\n\\n```ini\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, obj, agir\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = quelque (o\xf9 (p. ft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p. ub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\n```\\n\\n## Cr\xe9er une politique\\n\\n\xc0 partir du sc\xe9nario ci-dessus, la politique serait:\\n\\n```csv\\np, *, /, GET\\np, admin, *, *\\ng, alice, admin\\ng, bob, admin\\n```\\n\\nLa correspondance du mod\xe8le signifie :\\n\\n1. `(g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p. ub))`: Soit le sujet de la requ\xeate a un r\xf4le en tant que sujet de la r\xe8gle ou celui de la requ\xeate correspond au sujet de la r\xe8gle dans `keyMatch`. `keyMatch` est inclus dans la fonction Lua Casbin, vous pouvez jeter un \u0153il \xe0 la description de la fonction et plus de fonctions qui pourraient \xeatre utiles [ici](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/blob/master/src/util/BuiltInFunctions.lua).\\n2. `keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj)`: l\'objet de la requ\xeate correspond \xe0 l\'objet de la politique (chemin URL ici).\\n3. `keyMatch(r.act, p.act)`: l\'action de la requ\xeate correspond \xe0 l\'action de la politique (m\xe9thode de requ\xeate HTTP ici).\\n\\n## Activation du plugin sur la route\\n\\nUne fois que vous avez cr\xe9\xe9 le mod\xe8le et la politique, vous pouvez l\'activer sur une route en utilisant l\'API Admin APISIX.

Par exemple, si vous passez l\'en-t\xeate du nom d\'utilisateur en tant qu\'utilisateur `: alice`, vous utiliserez `\\"username\\": \\"user\\"`.\\n\\nPour utiliser le texte mod\xe8le/politique au lieu de fichiers, vous pouvez utiliser les champs `mod\xe8le` et `politique` \xe0 la place:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0. :9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"model\\": \\"[request_definition]\\n            r = sub, obj, act\\n\\n            [policy_definition]\\n            p = sub, obj, act\\n\\n            [role_definition]\\n            g = _, _\\n\\n            [policy_effect]\\n            e = quelque part (o\xf9 (p. ft == allow))\\n\\n            [matchers]\\n            m = (g(r. ub, p. ub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p. ct)\\",\\n\\n            \\"polices\\": \\"p, *, /, GET\\n            p, admin, *, *\\n            g, alice, admin\\n            g, bob, admin\\",\\n\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"amon\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127. 0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\n## Activer le plugin en utilisant un mod\xe8le/politique global\\n\\nIl peut y avoir des situations o\xf9 vous pourriez vouloir utiliser un mod\xe8le unique et une configuration de r\xe8gles sur plusieurs routes. Vous pouvez le faire d\'abord en envoyant une requ\xeate `PUT` pour ajouter le mod\xe8le et la configuration de la politique aux m\xe9tadonn\xe9es du plugin par:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0. :9080/apisix/admin/plugin_metadata/authz-casbin -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -i -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n\\"mod\xe8le\\": \\"[request_definition]\\nr = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = quelque part (o\xf9 (p. ft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r. ub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r. ct, p.act)\\",\\n\\n\\"policy\\": \\"p, *, /, GET\\np, admin, *, *\\ng, alice, admin\\ng, bob, admin\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nEt puis pour activer la m\xeame configuration sur une certaine route, envoyez une requ\xeate en utilisant l\'API Admin :\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0. :9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"amon\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127. 0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/route1/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nCeci ajoutera la configuration des m\xe9tadonn\xe9es du plugin \xe0 la route. Vous pouvez aussi facilement mettre \xe0 jour la configuration des m\xe9tadonn\xe9es du plugin en renvoyant la demande vers les m\xe9tadonn\xe9es du plugin avec la mise \xe0 jour du mod\xe8le et la configuration de la politique, le plugin mettra \xe0 jour automatiquement toutes les routes en utilisant les m\xe9tadonn\xe9es du plugin.\\n\\n## Cas d\'utilisation\\n\\n- Le cas d\'utilisation principal de ce plugin serait l\'impl\xe9mentation de l\'autorisation dans vos API. Vous pouvez facilement ajouter ce plugin sur n\'importe quelle route API que vous utilisez avec votre mod\xe8le d\'autorisation et la configuration de la politique.\\n- Si vous voulez avoir un mod\xe8le d\'autorisation unique pour toutes vos API, vous pouvez utiliser la m\xe9thode du mod\xe8le global. Cela rend la mise \xe0 jour de la politique facile pour tous les itin\xe9raires, car vous n\'avez qu\'\xe0 mettre \xe0 jour les m\xe9tadonn\xe9es dans etcd.\\n- Si vous souhaitez utiliser un mod\xe8le diff\xe9rent pour chaque itin\xe9raire, vous pouvez utiliser la m\xe9thode de l\'itin\xe9raire. Ceci est utile lorsque les diff\xe9rentes routes de l\'API ont diff\xe9rents ensembles de permissions d\'utilisateur. Vous pouvez \xe9galement utiliser cela lorsque vous avez affaire \xe0 des politiques plus importantes, car cela rendra l\u2019autorisation plus rapide lorsque filtr\xe9e sur plusieurs routes."},{"id":"/2020/04/21/google-award","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/04/21/google-award","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2020-04-21-google-award.md","source":"@site/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2020-04-21-google-award.md","title":"Yang Luo - Gagnant du bonus Google Open Source par les pairs","description":"Aujourd\'hui, nous sommes heureux d\'annoncer que le fondateur de Casbin, Yang Luo, a re\xe7u le prix \\"Google Open Source Peer Bonus diners\\" pour son travail sur Casbin, Np cap et IMAP au 3e trimestre 2019.","date":"2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.15,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Casbin","title":"Compte Officiel","url":"http://github.com/casbin","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/casbin","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Yang Luo - Gagnant du bonus Google Open Source par les pairs","author":"Casbin","authorTitle":"Compte Officiel","authorURL":"http://github.com/casbin","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/casbin"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Autorisation dans APISIX \xe0 l\'aide de Casbin","permalink":"/fr/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization"},"nextItem":{"title":"Refonte de notre documentation","permalink":"/fr/blog/2018/09/23/new-website"}},"content":"Aujourd\'hui, nous sommes heureux d\'annoncer que le fondateur de Casbin,[ Yang Luo](https://github.com/hsluoyz), a re\xe7u le prix \\"Google Open Source Peer Bonus diners\\" pour son travail sur [Casbin](/), [Np cap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) et [IMAP](https://nmap.org/) au 3e trimestre 2019.\\n\\n![ospb](https://hsluoyz.github.io/download/Open%20Source%20Peer%20Bonus%20Q3%202019%20-%20Yang%20Luo%20-%20OSPB%20Award%20Letter.png)\\n\\n> La lettre originale de r\xe9compense peut \xeatre consult\xe9e [ici](https://github.com/hsluoyz/hsluoyz.github.io/blob/master/download/Open%20Source%20Peer%20Bonus%20Q3%202019%20-%20Yang%20Luo%20-%20OSPB%20Award%20Letter.pdf).\\n\\nLe programme [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.google.com/docs/growing/peer-bonus/) est d\xe9crit comme :\\n\\n> _De la m\xeame mani\xe8re qu\'un bonus Google Pair est utilis\xe9 pour reconna\xeetre un autre Googler qui a d\xe9pass\xe9 et au-del\xe0, un bonus de pair Open Source reconna\xeet les personnes externes qui ont apport\xe9 des contributions exceptionnelles \xe0 l\'open source._\\n\\nL\'annonce [pour les gagnants de 2019](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/01/announcing-2019-second-cycle-google.html) est disponible \xe0 :\\n\\n> https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/01/announcing-2019-second-cycle-google.html\\n\\nYang et Casbin sont list\xe9s parmi les d\xe9veloppeurs et les projets open source qui ont un impact pertinent l\xe0-bas, comme Git, TensorFlow, V8, CPython, LLVM, projets Apache, Angular ou Jenkins.\\n\\nNous sommes heureux de voir que Casbin est ainsi reconnu pour sa contribution \xe0 la s\xe9curit\xe9 de l\'open source et du cloud!\\n\\n_Merci d\'avoir vol\xe9 Casbin!_"},{"id":"/2018/09/23/new-website","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2018/09/23/new-website","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2018-09-23-new-website.md","source":"@site/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2018-09-23-new-website.md","title":"Refonte de notre documentation","description":"Aujourd\'hui, nous avons migr\xe9 la documentation de Casbin depuis le Wiki GitHub vers les Docs de ce site, qui est propuls\xe9 par Docusaurus.
