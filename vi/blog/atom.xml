        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2024 was the year AI agents went from demos to production. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-world-has-changed">The World Has Changed<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#the-world-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến The World Has Changed" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến The World Has Changed" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.</p>
<p>The MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like <code>mcp:tools:weather</code> or <code>mcp:resources:customer-data:read</code>. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-were-working-on">What We're Working On<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#what-were-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến What We're Working On" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến What We're Working On" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="mcp-server-authorization">MCP Server Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#mcp-server-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến MCP Server Authorization" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến MCP Server Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?</p>
<p>Traditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just "is alice an admin" but "is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice's region during business hours." We're exploring how Casbin's policy model can express these constraints naturally.</p>
<p>The challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We're looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="edge-first-authorization">Edge-First Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#edge-first-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Edge-First Authorization" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Edge-First Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can't afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.</p>
<p>This is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don't have all the answers yet, but it's where things are heading.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they've built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="rag-pipeline-authorization">RAG Pipeline Authorization<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#rag-pipeline-authorization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến RAG Pipeline Authorization" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến RAG Pipeline Authorization" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Here's something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.</p>
<p>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists "Sensitive Information Disclosure" as a major risk. The solution isn't just filtering outputs - it's ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn't have access to in the first place.</p>
<p>This means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We're thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="multi-agent-scenarios">Multi-Agent Scenarios<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/casbin-2025-ai-agent-era#multi-agent-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Multi-Agent Scenarios" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Multi-Agent Scenarios" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.</p>
<p>The OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for "can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice" needs a proper model. Casbin's support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.</p>

<p>Of course, we're not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:</p>
<p><strong>Language implementations catching up</strong> - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The <code>in</code> operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the <code>g</code> function - these need to be consistent everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>New framework middlewares</strong> - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.</p>
<p><strong>Performance work</strong> - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.</p>

<p>Honestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we're learning as we go. Some open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Should Casbin have first-class primitives for "agent identity" vs "user identity"?</li>
<li class="">How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?</li>
<li class="">What's the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.</p>

<p>We've been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don't need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
<p>The next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We're excited to figure them out together.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the <a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Casbin</a> library. For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="introduction-to-rbac">Introduction to RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#introduction-to-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Introduction to RBAC" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Introduction to RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let's take a look at Azure's RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac">Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#understanding-azures-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png" alt="Azure Hierarchy" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There is a role called <strong>Owner</strong> for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the <strong>Owner</strong> role assigned to me at the
subscription level, that means I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
<strong>Owner</strong> at the resource group level, then I am the <strong>Owner</strong> of all the resources under that resource group.</p>
<p>This image shows that I have <strong>Owner</strong> access at the subscription level. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subscription Owner" src="https://casbin.org/vi/assets/images/subscription-owner-f1a7e1c9c03d7c587ce910ae5e6d8a35.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited <strong>Owner</strong> access from the
subscription. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="RG Owner" src="https://casbin.org/vi/assets/images/rg-owner-9c6cd2ae5997a5fba717c445f43130e6.png" width="3456" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So, this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="how-does-casbin-work">How Does Casbin Work?<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#how-does-casbin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến How Does Casbin Work?" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến How Does Casbin Work?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-acl">What is ACL?<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-acl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến What is ACL?" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến What is ACL?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="the-model-definition">The model definition<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#the-model-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến The model definition" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến The model definition" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider a simple example of an ACL model.</p>
<div class="language-toml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-toml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[request_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">r = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_definition]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">p = sub, act, obj</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[policy_effect]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">e = some(where (p.eft == allow))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[matchers]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>request_definition</strong> is the query template of the system. For example, a request <code>alice, write, data1</code> can be
interpreted as "Can subject Alice perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'?".</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_definition</strong> is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy <code>alice, write, data1</code>, you are
assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action 'write' on object 'data1'.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The <strong>policy_effect</strong> defines the effect of the policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>In the <strong>matchers</strong> section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions <code>r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="what-is-hierarchical-rbac">What is Hierarchical RBAC?<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail#what-is-hierarchical-rbac" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến What is Hierarchical RBAC?" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến What is Hierarchical RBAC?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, "subscription" is one type and "resourceGroup" is another type. A sub1 of type <strong>Subscription</strong> can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type <strong>ResourceGroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role <strong>sub-owner</strong>. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role <strong>rg-owner</strong>, which means that if I am assigned the <strong>sub-owner</strong> role on Subscription <strong>sub1</strong>, then I automatically also get the <strong>rg-owner</strong> role on <strong>rg1 and rg2</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">APISIX</a> là một cổng API đáng tin cậy, hiệu suất cao và có khả năng mở rộng dựa trên Nginx và etcd. Nó là một dự án nguồn mở của Quỹ Phần mềm Apache. Ngoài ra, điều làm cho APISIX trở nên tuyệt vời là sự hỗ trợ của nhiều plugin tích hợp đỉnh cao có thể được sử dụng để triển khai các tính năng như xác thực, giám sát, định tuyến, v.v. Và thực tế là các plugin trong APISIX được tải lại nóng (không cần khởi động lại) làm cho nó rất linh hoạt.</p>
<p>Tuy nhiên, khi sử dụng APISIX, có thể có những tình huống mà bạn muốn thêm logic ủy quyền phức tạp vào ứng dụng của mình. Đây là nơi mà authz-casbin có thể giúp bạn, authz-casbin là một plugin của APISIX dựa trên <a href="https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lua Casbin</a> cho phép ủy quyền mạnh mẽ dựa trên nhiều mô hình kiểm soát truy cập khác nhau. <a class="" href="https://casbin.org/vi/">Casbin</a> là một thư viện ủy quyền hỗ trợ các mô hình kiểm soát truy cập như ACL, RBAC, ABAC. Ban đầu được viết bằng Go, nó đã được chuyển sang nhiều ngôn ngữ khác và Lua Casbin là việc triển khai Lua của Casbin. Sự phát triển của authz-casbin bắt đầu khi chúng tôi đề xuất một plugin mới cho ủy quyền trong kho lưu trữ APISIX (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/4674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4674</a>) mà các thành viên chính đã đồng ý. Và sau những đánh giá hữu ích dẫn đến một số thay đổi và cải tiến lớn, PR (<a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/4710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#4710</a>) cuối cùng đã được hợp nhất.</p>
<p>Trong bài blog này, chúng tôi sẽ sử dụng plugin authz-casbin để chỉ ra cách bạn có thể triển khai một mô hình ủy quyền dựa trên Kiểm soát Truy cập Dựa trên Vai trò (RBAC) trong APISIX.</p>
<p><strong>LƯU Ý</strong>: Bạn sẽ cần sử dụng một số plugin khác hoặc quy trình làm việc tùy chỉnh để xác thực người dùng vì Casbin chỉ thực hiện ủy quyền, không phải xác thực.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="tạo-một-mô-hình">Tạo một mô hình<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#t%E1%BA%A1o-m%E1%BB%99t-m%C3%B4-h%C3%ACnh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Tạo một mô hình" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Tạo một mô hình" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Plugin sử dụng ba tham số để ủy quyền bất kỳ yêu cầu nào - chủ thể, đối tượng và hành động. Ở đây, chủ thể là giá trị của tiêu đề tên người dùng, có thể là một cái gì đó như <code>[username: alice]</code>. Sau đó, đối tượng là đường dẫn URL đang được truy cập và hành động là phương thức yêu cầu đang được sử dụng.</p>
<p>Giả sử chúng ta muốn tạo một mô hình với ba tài nguyên tại các đường dẫn - <code>/`\`, </code>/res1<code>\</code> và ``/res2<code>\</code>. Và chúng ta muốn có một mô hình như thế này:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="hình ảnh" src="https://casbin.org/vi/assets/images/model-1c0c2441dd19f8b957744635985283eb.png" width="4520" height="1720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Điều này có nghĩa là tất cả người dùng (<code>*`\`) ví dụ như </code>jack<code>\</code> có thể truy cập trang chủ (<code>/`\`). Và người dùng có quyền </code>admin<code>\</code> như <code>alice`\` và </code>bob<code>\</code> có thể truy cập tất cả các trang và tài nguyên (như <code>res1`\` và </code>res2<code>\</code>). Ngoài ra, hãy giới hạn người dùng không có bất kỳ quyền admin nào chỉ sử dụng phương thức yêu cầu ``GET<code>\</code>. Đối với kịch bản này, chúng ta có thể định nghĩa mô hình như sau:</p>

<p>Điều này sẽ thêm cấu hình siêu dữ liệu plugin vào tuyến đường. Bạn cũng có thể dễ dàng cập nhật cấu hình siêu dữ liệu plugin bằng cách gửi lại yêu cầu đến siêu dữ liệu của plugin với cấu hình mô hình và chính sách đã cập nhật, plugin sẽ tự động cập nhật tất cả các tuyến đường sử dụng siêu dữ liệu plugin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_vjPI" id="trường-hợp-sử-dụng">Trường hợp sử dụng<a href="https://casbin.org/vi/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization#tr%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng-h%E1%BB%A3p-s%E1%BB%AD-d%E1%BB%A5ng" class="hash-link" aria-label="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Trường hợp sử dụng" title="Đường dẫn trực tiếp đến Trường hợp sử dụng" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class="">Trường hợp sử dụng chính của plugin này sẽ là trong việc thực hiện ủy quyền trong các API của bạn. Bạn có thể dễ dàng thêm plugin này vào bất kỳ tuyến đường API nào mà bạn đang sử dụng với mô hình ủy quyền và cấu hình chính sách của mình.</li>
<li class="">Nếu bạn muốn có một mô hình ủy quyền duy nhất cho tất cả các API của mình, bạn có thể sử dụng phương pháp mô hình/chính sách toàn cầu. Điều này giúp cập nhật chính sách dễ dàng cho tất cả các tuyến đường, vì bạn chỉ cần cập nhật siêu dữ liệu trong etcd.</li>
<li class="">Trong khi đó, nếu bạn muốn sử dụng một mô hình khác nhau cho mỗi tuyến đường khác nhau, bạn có thể sử dụng phương pháp tuyến đường. Điều này rất hữu ích khi các tuyến API khác nhau có các tập hợp quyền người dùng khác nhau. Bạn cũng có thể sử dụng điều này khi bạn đang xử lý các chính sách lớn hơn, vì nó sẽ làm cho việc ủy quyền nhanh hơn khi được lọc vào nhiều tuyến.</li>

<p><strong>Máy chủ Casbin</strong> đang được phát triển tích cực bởi nhóm chính của chúng tôi. Nó có một số tính năng:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Được phát triển hoàn toàn bằng Golang.</li>
<li class="">Có thể quản lý hàng ngàn phiên bản Casbin, giúp bạn chuyển đổi logic thực thi chính sách từ nhiều dịch vụ vào một Máy chủ Casbin.</li>
<li class=""><strong>gRPC</strong> được sử dụng để giao tiếp với Máy chủ Casbin. Chúng tôi cũng xem xét việc thêm hỗ trợ <strong>RESTful</strong> trong tương lai gần.</li>
<li class="">Một cổng quản trị web thân thiện được cung cấp cho các quản trị viên không phải là nhà phát triển để quản lý tất cả các chi tiết như phiên bản Casbin, mô hình, lưu trữ chính sách và cân bằng tải.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mã nguồn được lưu trữ trên GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server</a></p>
<p>Bất kỳ vấn đề hoặc yêu cầu kéo nào cũng đều được hoan nghênh :)</p>]]></content>
