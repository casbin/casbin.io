With the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gaining adoption from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless others, we\'re seeing a fundamental shift in how applications interact with external services. And with that shift comes a whole new set of authorization challenges that we at Casbin have been thinking about.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The World Has Changed\\n\\nWhen we started Casbin back in 2017, the typical authorization scenario was straightforward: a user makes a request, we check if they have permission, done. Today? An AI agent might be acting on behalf of a user, calling multiple MCP servers, each with their own tool permissions, and the whole thing needs to happen in milliseconds at the edge.\\n\\nThe MCP specification now explicitly classifies MCP servers as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers (as of the June 2025 update), requiring fine-grained scopes like `mcp:tools:weather` or `mcp:resources:customer-data:read`. This is exactly the kind of granular permission model Casbin was built for - but the integration story needs work.\\n\\n## What We\'re Working On\\n\\n### MCP Server Authorization\\n\\nThis is probably the most exciting area for us right now. When an AI agent calls an MCP server, that server needs to decide: can this agent, acting on behalf of this user, invoke this specific tool with these parameters?\\n\\nTraditional RBAC falls short here. You need something more like ABAC - checking not just \\"is alice an admin\\" but \\"is this agent authorized to access customer data for alice\'s region during business hours.\\" We\'re exploring how Casbin\'s policy model can express these constraints naturally.\\n\\nThe challenge is that MCP servers need to make these decisions fast. Really fast. We\'re looking at lightweight policy evaluation that can run in the MCP server process itself, rather than making network calls to a separate authorization service.\\n\\n### Edge-First Authorization\\n\\nCloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge Functions - the edge computing space has exploded. In 2025, sub-50ms response times are table stakes, and you can\'t afford to add 100ms for an authorization check to some central server.\\n\\nThis is pushing us to think differently about how Casbin works. Can we compile policies to WebAssembly and run them directly in V8 isolates? Can we do smart policy caching at the edge while maintaining consistency? These are hard problems, and we don\'t have all the answers yet, but it\'s where things are heading.\\n\\nWe\'re particularly interested in the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem - they\'ve built out a whole platform for MCP servers with built-in OAuth support. A native Casbin integration there could be powerful.\\n\\n### RAG Pipeline Authorization\\n\\nHere\'s something that keeps coming up: companies building RAG systems where the LLM needs access to internal documents, but different users should see different documents in their responses.\\n\\nThe OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 lists \\"Sensitive Information Disclosure\\" as a major risk. The solution isn\'t just filtering outputs - it\'s ensuring the LLM never sees documents the user shouldn\'t have access to in the first place.\\n\\nThis means authorization checks need to happen at the vector store query level. We\'re thinking about how Casbin policies can translate into metadata filters for vector databases - essentially, turning a permission check into a WHERE clause that gets pushed down to the retrieval layer.\\n\\n### Multi-Agent Scenarios\\n\\nWhen you have multiple AI agents collaborating - think a coding agent that calls a deployment agent that calls a monitoring agent - permission delegation gets tricky. Each agent in the chain might have different capabilities, and you need to track the full chain of custody.\\n\\nThe OAuth On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow handles some of this, but the authorization logic for \\"can agent B do X on behalf of agent A on behalf of user alice\\" needs a proper model. Casbin\'s support for role hierarchies and domain-based RBAC could extend naturally to agent hierarchies, but we need to think through the semantics carefully.\\n\\n## The Traditional Roadmap Stuff\\n\\nOf course, we\'re not abandoning the basics. Some practical things on our list:\\n\\n**Language implementations catching up** - SwiftCasbin and Lua-Casbin are still behind on features compared to the Go and Node.js versions. The `in` operator, WatcherEx, better caching for the `g` function - these need to be consistent everywhere.\\n\\n**New framework middlewares** - go-zero has been requested repeatedly. Poem for Rust is gaining traction. Play Framework for Java has been on the wishlist forever.\\n\\n**Performance work** - As policies get more complex for these new use cases, evaluation speed matters more. We need better benchmarking, profiling, and optimization across all implementations.\\n\\n## What We Don\'t Know Yet\\n\\nHonestly, the AI agent authorization space is moving so fast that we\'re learning as we go. Some open questions:\\n\\n- Should Casbin have first-class primitives for \\"agent identity\\" vs \\"user identity\\"?\\n- How do you handle authorization for tools that are dynamically discovered via MCP?\\n- What\'s the right caching strategy when policies might depend on real-time context?\\n\\nIf you\'re building in this space and running into authorization problems, we want to hear about it. The best features come from real use cases.\\n\\n## Getting Involved\\n\\nWe\'ve been a GSoC organization for years, and these AI-related projects are exactly the kind of thing that makes for interesting summer projects. But you don\'t need to wait for GSoC - if any of this sounds interesting, come chat with us on Discord or open an issue on GitHub.\\n\\nThe next few years are going to be wild for authorization. The problems are harder, but also more interesting. We\'re excited to figure them out together."},{"id":"/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-12-08-understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail.md","source":"@site/i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-12-08-understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail.md","title":"Understanding How Casbin Matching Works in Detail","description":"In this post, I will explain the design and implementation of RBAC using the Casbin library.

For a SaaS platform dealing with multiple resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels, Casbin provides a performant alternative to consider.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction to RBAC\\n\\nRBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles that individuals hold. To better understand how hierarchical RBAC works, let\'s take a look at Azure\'s RBAC system in the next section and then attempt to implement a similar system.\\n\\n## Understanding Azure\'s Hierarchical RBAC\\n\\n![Azure Hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png)\\n\\nThere is a role called **Owner** for all resources in Azure. Suppose if I have the **Owner** role assigned to me at the\\nsubscription level, that means I am the **Owner** of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have\\n**Owner** at the resource group level, then I am the **Owner** of all the resources under that resource group.\\n\\nThis image shows that I have **Owner** access at the subscription level. ![Subscription Owner](/img/tutorial/subscription-owner.png)\\n\\nWhen I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see that I have inherited **Owner** access from the\\nsubscription. ![RG Owner](/img/tutorial/rg-owner.png)\\n\\nSo, this is how Azure\'s RBAC is hierarchical. Most enterprise software uses hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical\\nnature of the resource levels. In this tutorial, we\'ll try to implement a similar system using Casbin.\\n\\n## How Does Casbin Work?\\n\\nBefore diving into the implementation, it is important to understand what Casbin is and how it functions at a high level. This understanding is necessary because each Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system may vary based on specific requirements. By grasping the workings of Casbin, we can effectively fine-tune the model.\\n\\n## What is ACL?\\n\\nACL stands for Access Control List. It is a method in which users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s consider a simple example of an ACL model.\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act\\n```\\n\\n1. The **request_definition** is the query template of the system. For example, a request `alice, write, data1` can be\\n   interpreted as \\"Can subject Alice perform the action \'write\' on object \'data1\'?\\".\\n\\n2. The **policy_definition** is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy `alice, write, data1`, you are\\n   assigning permission to subject Alice to perform the action \'write\' on object \'data1\'.\\n\\n3. The **policy_effect** defines the effect of the policy.\\n\\n4. In the **matchers** section, the request is matched with the policy using the conditions `r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act`.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, read, data1\\np, bob, write, data2\\n```\\n\\nand the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, read, data1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the ACL model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![acl](/img/tutorial/acl.png)\\n\\n## What is RBAC?\\n\\nRBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In RBAC, a user is assigned a role for a resource, and a role can contain arbitrary actions. The request then checks if the user has the permission to perform the action on the resource.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s consider a simple example RBAC model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\ng2 = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && r.obj == p.obj\\n```\\n\\n1. The **role_definition** is a graph relation builder that uses a Graph to compare the request object with the policy object.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, reader, data1\\np, bob, owner, data2\\n\\ng, reader, read\\ng, owner, read\\ng, owner, write\\n```\\n\\nand the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, read, data1\\nalice, write, data1\\nbob, write, data2\\nbob, read, data2\\nbob, write, data1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\nfalse\\ntrue\\ntrue\\nfalse\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![rbac](/img/tutorial/rbac.png)\\n\\nThe **g - Role to action mapping** table has a Graph mapping the role to action. This Graph can be coded as a list of edges, as shown in the policy which is a common way of representing a Graph:\\n\\n```csv\\ng, reader, read\\ng, owner, read\\ng, owner, write\\n```\\n\\n:::info\\n\\n**p** indicates a normal policy that can be compared using the **==** operator. **g** is a Graph-based comparison function. You can define multiple Graph comparators by adding a numerical suffix like **g, g2, g3, ...** and so on.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## What is Hierarchical RBAC?\\n\\nIn Hierarchical RBAC, there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types. For example, \\"subscription\\" is one type and \\"resourceGroup\\" is another type. A sub1 of type **Subscription** can contain multiple resourceGroups (rg1, rg2) of type **ResourceGroup**.\\n\\nSimilar to the resource hierarchy, there will be two types of roles and actions: Subscription roles and actions, and ResourceGroup roles and actions. There is an arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role. For example, consider a Subscription Role **sub-owner**. This role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role **rg-owner**, which means that if I am assigned the **sub-owner** role on Subscription **sub1**, then I automatically also get the **rg-owner** role on **rg1 and rg2**.\\n\\n### The model definition\\n\\nLet\'s take a simple example of the **Hierarchical RBAC** model:\\n\\n```toml\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, act, obj\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\ng2 = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && g2(p.obj, r.obj)\\n```\\n\\n1. The **role_definition** is a graph relation builder which uses a Graph to compare the request object with the policy object.\\n\\n### Now let\'s test the model on the Casbin editor\\n\\nOpen the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.\\n\\nPaste the following in the Policy editor:\\n\\n```csv\\np, alice, sub-reader, sub1\\np, bob, rg-owner, rg2\\n\\n// subscription role to subscription action mapping\\ng, sub-reader, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-write\\n\\n// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping\\ng, rg-reader, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-write\\n\\n// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping\\ng, sub-reader, rg-reader\\ng, sub-owner, rg-owner\\n\\n// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping\\ng2, sub1, rg1\\ng2, sub2, rg2\\n```\\n\\nAnd paste the following in the Request editor:\\n\\n```csv\\nalice, rg-read, rg1\\n```\\n\\nThe result will be:\\n\\n```text\\ntrue\\n```\\n\\n### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching\\n\\n![hrbac](/img/tutorial/hrbac.png)\\n\\nThe **g - Role to (Action, Role) Mapping** table has a graph mapping the role to the action, role mapping. This graph can be coded as a list of edges, as shown in the policy, which is a common way of representing a graph:\\n\\n```csv\\n// subscription role to subscription action mapping\\ng, sub-reader, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-read\\ng, sub-owner, sub-write\\n\\n// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping\\ng, rg-reader, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-read\\ng, rg-owner, rg-write\\n\\n// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping\\ng, sub-reader, rg-reader\\ng, sub-owner, rg-owner\\n```\\n\\nThe **g2 - Sub to RG Mapping** table has a graph mapping subscription to resourceGroup:\\n\\n```csv\\n// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping\\ng2, sub1, rg1\\ng2, sub2, rg2\\n```\\n\\n#### Subject Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-sub-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-sub-match.png)\\n\\n#### Action Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-act-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-act-match.png)\\n\\n#### Object Matching Visual representation\\n\\n![hrbac-obj-match](/img/tutorial/hrbac-obj-match.png)\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nWhen a request is submitted to Casbin, this matching happens for all the policies. If at least one policy matches, then the result of the request is true. If no policy matches the request, then the result is false.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we learned about how different authorization models work and how they can be modeled using Casbin. In the second part of this tutorial, we will implement this in a demo Spring Boot Application and secure the APIs using Casbin."},{"id":"/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-08-19-apisix-casbin-authorization.md","source":"@site/i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-08-19-apisix-casbin-authorization.md","title":"Autorizaci\xf3n en APISIX usando Casbin","description":"Introducci\xf3n","date":"2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":5.84,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Rushikesh Tote","title":"Member of Casbin","url":"https://github.com/rushitote","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/rushitote","key":"rushitote","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Autorizaci\xf3n en APISIX usando Casbin","authors":["rushitote"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding How Casbin Matching Works in Detail","permalink":"/es/blog/2023/12/08/understanding-casbin-matching-in-detail"},"nextItem":{"title":"Yang Luo - Ganador del Premio Google Open Source Peer Bonus","permalink":"/es/blog/2020/04/21/google-award"}},"content":"## Introducci\xf3n\\n\\n[APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/) es una puerta de enlace API nativa de la nube de alto rendimiento y escalable basada en Nginx y etcd.

Adem\xe1s, restrinjamos a los usuarios sin ning\xfan permiso de administrador a usar solo el m\xe9todo de solicitud `GET`. Para este escenario, podr\xedamos definir el modelo como:\\n\\n```ini\\n[request_definition]\\nr = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\n```\\n\\n## Creando una pol\xedtica\\n\\nDel escenario anterior, la pol\xedtica ser\xeda:\\n\\n```csv\\np, *, /, GET\\np, admin, *, *\\ng, alice, admin\\ng, bob, admin\\n```\\n\\nEl comparador del modelo significa:\\n\\n1. `(g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub))`: O bien el sujeto de la solicitud tiene un rol como el sujeto de la pol\xedtica o el sujeto de la solicitud coincide con el sujeto de la pol\xedtica en `keyMatch`. `keyMatch` es una funci\xf3n integrada en Lua Casbin, puedes echar un vistazo a la descripci\xf3n de la funci\xf3n y m\xe1s funciones que podr\xedan ser \xfatiles [aqu\xed](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/blob/master/src/util/BuiltInFunctions.lua).\\n2. `keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj)`: El objeto de la solicitud coincide con el objeto de la pol\xedtica (ruta URL aqu\xed).\\n3. `keyMatch(r.act, p.act)`: La acci\xf3n de la solicitud coincide con la acci\xf3n de la pol\xedtica (m\xe9todo de solicitud HTTP aqu\xed).\\n\\n## Habilitando el complemento en la ruta\\n\\nUna vez que hayas creado el modelo y la pol\xedtica, puedes habilitarlo en una ruta utilizando la API de administraci\xf3n de APISIX.

Puedes hacerlo primero enviando una solicitud `PUT` para agregar la configuraci\xf3n de modelo y pol\xedtica a los metadatos del complemento por:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/plugin_metadata/authz-casbin -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -i -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n\\"model\\": \\"[request_definition]\\nr = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[policy_definition]\\np = sub, obj, act\\n\\n[role_definition]\\ng = _, _\\n\\n[policy_effect]\\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\\n\\n[matchers]\\nm = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)\\",\\n\\n\\"policy\\": \\"p, *, /, GET\\np, admin, *, *\\ng, alice, admin\\ng, bob, admin\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nY luego para habilitar la misma configuraci\xf3n en alguna ruta, env\xeda una solicitud usando la API de administraci\xf3n:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H \'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\' -X PUT -d \'\\n{\\n    \\"plugins\\": {\\n        \\"authz-casbin\\": {\\n            \\"username\\": \\"username\\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \\"upstream\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": {\\n            \\"127.0.0.1:1980\\": 1\\n        },\\n        \\"type\\": \\"roundrobin\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"uri\\": \\"/route1/*\\"\\n}\'\\n```\\n\\nEsto agregar\xe1 la configuraci\xf3n de metadatos del complemento a la ruta. Tambi\xe9n puedes actualizar f\xe1cilmente la configuraci\xf3n de metadatos del complemento reenviando la solicitud a los metadatos del complemento con la configuraci\xf3n de modelo y pol\xedtica actualizada, el complemento actualizar\xe1 autom\xe1ticamente todas las rutas que usan la configuraci\xf3n de metadatos del complemento.\\n\\n## Casos de uso\\n\\n- El caso de uso principal de este complemento ser\xeda en la implementaci\xf3n de autorizaci\xf3n en tus API. Puedes agregar f\xe1cilmente este complemento en cualquier ruta de API que est\xe9s utilizando con tu modelo de autorizaci\xf3n y configuraci\xf3n de pol\xedtica.\\n- Si deseas tener un \xfanico modelo de autorizaci\xf3n para todas tus API, puedes usar el m\xe9todo de modelo/pol\xedtica global. Esto facilita la actualizaci\xf3n de la pol\xedtica para todas las rutas, ya que solo necesitas actualizar los metadatos en etcd.\\n- Mientras que si te gustar\xeda usar un modelo diferente para cada ruta diferente, puedes usar el m\xe9todo de ruta. Esto es \xfatil cuando diferentes rutas de la API tienen diferentes conjuntos de permisos de usuario. Tambi\xe9n puedes usar esto cuando est\xe1s tratando con pol\xedticas m\xe1s grandes, ya que har\xe1 que la autorizaci\xf3n sea m\xe1s r\xe1pida cuando se filtre en m\xfaltiples rutas."},{"id":"/2020/04/21/google-award","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/2020/04/21/google-award","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2020-04-21-google-award.md","source":"@site/i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2020-04-21-google-award.md","title":"Yang Luo - Ganador del Premio Google Open Source Peer Bonus","description":"Hoy, nos complace anunciar que el fundador de Casbin, Yang Luo ha sido galardonado con el premio \\"Ganadores del Google Open Source Peer Bonus\\" por su trabajo en Casbin, Npcap y Nmap en el tercer trimestre de 2019.","date":"2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.17,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Casbin","title":"Official Account","url":"https://github.com/casbin","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/casbin","key":"casbin","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Yang Luo - Ganador del Premio Google Open Source Peer Bonus","authors":["casbin"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Autorizaci\xf3n en APISIX usando Casbin","permalink":"/es/blog/2021/08/19/apisix-casbin-authorization"},"nextItem":{"title":"Reestructuraci\xf3n de nuestra Documentaci\xf3n","permalink":"/es/blog/2018/09/23/new-website"}},"content":"Hoy, nos complace anunciar que el fundador de Casbin, [Yang Luo](https://github.com/hsluoyz) ha sido galardonado con el premio \\"Ganadores del Google Open Source Peer Bonus\\" por su trabajo en [Casbin](/), [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) y [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) en el tercer trimestre de 2019.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![ospb](https://hsluoyz.github.io/download/Open%20Source%20Peer%20Bonus%20Q3%202019%20-%20Yang%20Luo%20-%20OSPB%20Award%20Letter.png)\\n\\n> La carta original del premio se puede acceder [aqu\xed](https://github.com/hsluoyz/hsluoyz.github.io/blob/master/download/Open%20Source%20Peer%20Bonus%20Q3%202019%20-%20Yang%20Luo%20-%20OSPB%20Award%20Letter.pdf).\\n\\nEl programa [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.google.com/docs/growing/peer-bonus/) se describe como:\\n\\n> _De la misma manera que un Google Peer Bonus se utiliza para reconocer a un compa\xf1ero de Google que ha ido m\xe1s all\xe1, un Open Source Peer Bonus reconoce a personas externas que han hecho contribuciones excepcionales al c\xf3digo abierto._\\n\\nEl [anuncio de los ganadores de 2019](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/01/announcing-2019-second-cycle-google.html) est\xe1 disponible en:\\n\\n> https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/01/announcing-2019-second-cycle-google.html\\n\\nYang y Casbin est\xe1n listados entre los desarrolladores y proyectos de c\xf3digo abierto que han tenido un impacto relevante, como Git, TensorFlow, V8, CPython, LLVM, proyectos Apache, Angular o Jenkins.\\n\\n\xa1Estamos contentos de ver a Casbin reconocido de esta manera por su contribuci\xf3n al c\xf3digo abierto y la seguridad en la nube!\\n\\n_\xa1Gracias por volar con Casbin!_"},{"id":"/2018/09/23/new-website","metadata":{"permalink":"/es/blog/2018/09/23/new-website","editUrl":"https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2/edit/master/i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2018-09-23-new-website.md","source":"@site/i18n/es/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2018-09-23-new-website.md","title":"Reestructuraci\xf3n de nuestra Documentaci\xf3n","description":"Hoy, hemos migrado la documentaci\xf3n de Casbin desde GitHub Wiki a Docs de este sitio web, que est\xe1 potenciado por Docusaurus.
